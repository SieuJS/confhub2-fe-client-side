Although currently a small scientific field, Functional Food Science is quickly expanding as studies show that functional food products can help manage chronic disease and promote overall wellness. This is reflected in our journal’s rapidly growing citation score. The articles we publish include cutting-edge biomedical research and development of functional foods. The goal is to provide research that can lead to the development of functional food products. The actual definition for these functional foods, as provided by the Functional Food Center (FFC) is as follows: “Natural or processed foods that contain biologically-active compounds, which, in defined, effective, non-toxic amounts, provide a clinically proven and documented health benefit utilizing specific biomarkers, to promote optimal health and reduce the risk of chronic/viral diseases and manage their symptoms.\" The journal also serves as an excellent resource for Ph.D. students, professors, public health professionals, medical doctors, dieticians, nutritionists, government representatives (FDA, NIH, USDA), and the general public for information regarding the latest advancements for promoting optimal health and reducing the risk of chronic/viral diseases and managing their symptoms using functional foods and bioactive compounds including antioxidants, vitamins, and many more.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100983143&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100983143\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Journal will also consider the occasional publication of associated, but closely related, research in the form of an additional scientific communication platform [e.g. a re-make of the former Genetic Resources Communication series of the former Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia].

However, Sindhis live in other parts of Pakistan as well as in India and across the globe. The journal accepts submissions that address the people of Sindh, regardless of their current geographic location. JOSS aims to shed interdisciplinary light on the “Sindhi World.” It accepts submissions from all disciplines but prioritizes perspectives from the humanities and interpretive social sciences (e.g., anthropology, history, sociology, geography, literature, art history, and visual studies). The journal’s humanistic and interpretive approach aims to draw submissions into a single comparative forum to analyze, discuss, and understand the many intricate and multilayered contexts that constitute the Sindh region and the lives of its people. JOSS also approaches Sindhi Studies as a field to address broader questions about society and the human condition, both in the past and present. It privileges submissions that, in addition to Sindh and Sindhis, tackle topics like colonialism and nationalism, integration and marginalization, devotion and institutionalization, vernacularism and cosmopolitanism, and many others. The journal strives toward a better general understanding of the world by addressing it through the lens of Sindhi Studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"History","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101174189&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101174189\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Throughout the world, there is a growing awareness of the significance of vocational and post-compulsory education and training systems. The majority of countries are working hard to develop their provision, recognising the importance of post-compulsory education in providing educated and skilled people in sufficient numbers at appropriate levels to assist economic and social development. Research in Post-Compulsory Education, sponsored by the United Kingdom’s Association for Research in Post-Compulsory Education (ARPCE), recognises the need for more international research and analysis, and the generation of relevant theory in order to identify policy needs and trends as well as priorities in this growing area. While reporting current research, the journal also actively encourages the further development of research for post-compulsory education. The journal is essential reading for policy-makers and researchers, practitioners and practitioner-researchers in all the different spheres of post-compulsory education including vocational/technical education, adult and continuing education, community education, schools, further and higher education. The Editorial Board and Advisory Board members are drawn from many countries to take account of the need for wide representation and editorial expertise.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=7000153220&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=7000153220\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Journal accepts and offers papers within this broad range of issues focussing on the management, policy, marketing, consumer aspects, transparency, e-commerce, institutional or regional development, information and communication systems, ressource economics, production economics, chain management, network economics, and similar aspects. Papers may focus on modeling, empirical research or theoretical analyis. This broad range of publication opportunities asks authors to follow clear lines of arguments and to present arguments in a convincing way that avoids unnecessary complexities of model formulations if not relevant for the support of arguments. The publication of scientific articles is complemented by a number of sections that provide room for publications with a more specific focus: 'Case studies': A section on case studies of the 'Harvard Type' allows the publication of studies that might build on established scientific methodology but demonstrate its use in ceratin decision environments. Case studies might be complemented by 'teaching cases' that are kept on a database outside the journal but accessible to readers on approval by authors.

An early editorial decision was to concentrate on the geography of Ireland and this has been maintained ever since. More recently, to reflect the changing context and increased importance of globalization and migration to Ireland, an editorial decision was made to extend the scope of the journal to include contributions on the Irish diaspora and overseas networks. In addition to research articles, the journal publishes shorter commentaries, topical reviews, theoretical discussions and book reviews. We encourage contributions within the scope of the journal from those working in a range of disciplines, encourage work by early career researchers and consider comparative papers with a significant Irish component.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29241&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29241\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Open-access, it publishes research quickly and free of charge in order to have a maximal impact upon policy and practice communities. It fills a crucial niche. Despite the allocation of significant policy attention and financial resources to a perceived relationship between development assistance, security and stability, a solid evidence base is still lacking. Research in this area, while growing rapidly, is scattered across journals focused upon broader topics such as international development, international relations and security studies. Accordingly, Stability's objective is to: Foster an accessible and rigorous evidence base, clearly communicated and widely disseminated, to guide future thinking, policymaking and practice concerning communities and states experiencing widespread violence and conflict. The journal will accept submissions from a wide variety of disciplines, including development studies, international relations, politics, economics, anthropology, sociology, psychology and history, among others. In addition to focusing upon large-scale armed conflict and insurgencies, Stability will address the challenge posed by local and regional violence within ostensibly stable settings such as Mexico, Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and elsewhere.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100423127&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100423127\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal provides a platform for the dissemination of the current social drug policy research and seeks to stimulate critical debates about social, health and political consequences and contexts of drug use. DHSP aims to highlight cultural, social and material contexts of drug use, policy, and professional practices. We welcome submissions that highlight the lived experiences of people who use drugs and engage with evidence of harm reduction. National and international policy frameworks developed to control the production, distribution and use of psychoactive substances, both legal and illegal, are of particular interest. The journal aims to contribute to the critical debate on the international drug control regime, the dominant problematisation and medicalisation of drug use and the criminalisation of people who use drugs. In this mission, we also welcome practitioner papers that specifically address professionals and users engaged in drug services and the development of harm reduction initiatives on global and local scales. DHSP is committed to the use of sensitive and inclusive language and encourages submissions that are critical of disease-informed models of drug use. It is our aim to provide a platform for open and mindful reflections in high-quality research about drugs from across the world. DHSP welcomes original research articles using qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods designs, practitioner papers, policy papers, and book reviews.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101126440&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101126440\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Gateways provides an inclusive forum for faculty, staff, students, professional practitioners and community representatives to explore issues and reflect on methodological practices relating to the full range of engaged activity. Articles include empirical case studies; analyses of partnership models, practices and processes; and theoretical reflections that contribute to the scholarship of engagement. A central aspect of community-based research and practice is that it seeks to drive change - social, intellectual, institutional. As such, Gateways encourages innovative, mutually beneficial and culturally competent research approaches to conceptualising, designing, undertaking and communicating engaged research. Articles will not only bridge disciplinary boundaries but will seek to challenge traditional binaries of academic and non-academic knowledge systems by rigorously combining different ways of knowing and being. Gateways welcomes articles that articulate and interrogate the complex tensions that exist between theory and practice, and between the various participants in the research enterprise, as well as advance the value of research that is driven by need as much as curiosity. Further, Gateways is avowedly international in scope, actively seeking to make the journal a space for diverse voices and perspectives, in multiple forms and modes and from across different geographies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101117185&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101117185\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It was launched in 1911 and between 1926 and 1935 it was the main publication outlet for the Prague Linguistic Circle. It is concerned with contrastive linguistics, the study of West-European languages in contrast with Czech (or Slovak). The focus is primarily on major European languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese), to a minor extent on other languages. Items include original articles covering all aspects of contrastive linguistic description, along with interdisciplinary approaches. However, in view of the range of other, specialized periodicals, Journal for Modern Philology does not, with a few exceptions, accept items dealing with issues concerning Slavic Studies, Oriental Studies, teaching methodology, Translation Studies and Literary Sciences.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5800207569&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5800207569\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal encourages both empirical and the theoretical contributions that advance scientometric research (in its widest interpretation) and also reaches out to scholars of science and technology studies (STS), sociology, economics and other related fields that use scientometric data as the ‘object of investigation’ or apply scientometric analysis in innovation and STS studies. The journal thus publishes articles in all the different domains of scientometrics, including patent studies (techometrics) and web-based studies (webometrics). It also publishes articles that apply science-technology-innovation indicators to draw inasights of country/regional/sectoral research, innovation, and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Papers in areas of contemporary focus such as open science, new tools, and techniques including new approaches for information retrieval, metrics, and new forms of publications among others are encouraged. The journal has various categories in which articles can be submitted, Please refer instructions to authors for this and other details.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100983214&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100983214\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The social sciences have not been immune to the effects of this transformation, but a great deal of relevant information that has been discovered in related fields of study that include inter alia sociology, psychology, history and anthropology, is yet to be fully incorporated into the central body of economic doctrines taught in colleges and universities. Economics, as a result, has immense scope to benefit from the exciting developments that have occurred in these related fields as also from those occurring in the physical sciences, philosophy, technology and mathematics. The Journal of Interdisciplinary Economics is a forum in which those who wish to expand the boundaries of economic science are invited to contribute research that seeks out the hidden assumptions that determine the economist’s current world view, relax them and so evolve a new discipline more appropriate to the contemporary global environment, thereby enabling economists to tackle problems that have been created within that environment. The Journal of Interdisciplinary Economics is a peer reviewed bi-annual journal which publishes papers and comments from academicians and practitioners on topics that focus from an interdisciplinary perspective, on neglected boundary areas, hidden assumptions, and axioms in economics that may not be self-evident. Papers and comments are also welcome in response to the papers and comments.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=24391&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=24391\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

As an international open access journal, we aim to break down siloed specialisms, bringing together all experts to foster better collaboration and information sharing across the life sciences. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations (UN) Member States in 2015, produced 17 Sustainable Goals (SDGs) as a “blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the plant, now and into the future”. Supporting these UN SDGs, All Life broadly provides valuable insights and data towards goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production),14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life on Land). Accepting original research, reviews, short communications, data notes and commentaries, All Life welcomes submission of negative results and replication studies. Proposals of themed collections are encouraged. Letters to the Editor are also accepted and should discuss an analysis of an article previously published in All Life. All Life mandates all associated data sets be made publicly available, please ensure data is deposited in a community recognized repository and given a unique digital object identifier (doi) prior to submission. All Life has a diverse audience so authors should ensure their findings are clearly presented and technical information clearly explained.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101021075&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101021075\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The publication is as precise and comprehensive as possible. To this aim, the publication of each algorithm is fourfold and includes: a manuscript containing the detailed description of the published algorithm, of its bibliography, along with commented examples and a failure case analysis; a software implementation of the algorithm in C, C++ or Matlab; an online demo, where the algorithm can be tested on data sets uploaded by the users; an archive containing extensive online experiments. The restricted goal of IPOL is to make accessible the algorithms in their uttermost explicit form to the scientific community. The publication of an algorithm by IPOL is different from, and complementary to a classic journal publication.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100824667&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100824667\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This leading international journal brings together scholars from a variety of disciplines to explore and critically examine diverse perspective on educational phenomena, from schools and cultural institutions to sites and concerns beyond institutional boundaries. The journal publishes articles that explore historical, philosophical, gendered, queer, racial, ethnic, indigenous, postcolonial, linguistic, autobiographical, aesthetic, theological, and/or international curriculum concerns and issues. The Journal of Curriculum and Pedagogy aims to promote emergent scholarship that critiques and extends curriculum questions and education foundations that have relation to practice by embracing a plurality of critical, decolonizing education sciences that inform local struggles in universities, schools, classroom, and communities. This journal provides a platform for critical scholarship that will counter-narrate Eurocratic, whitened, instrumentalized, mainstream education.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100780474&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100780474\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It publishes research on the theory, practice, processes and outcomes of diplomacy in both its traditional state-based forms, as well as contemporary diplomatic expressions practiced by states and non-state entities. Each issue aims at a balance between theoretical and empirical studies and usually it features one practitioner’s essay. A central aim of the journal is to present work from a variety of intellectual traditions. Diplomatic studies is an inter-disciplinary field, including contributions from international relations, history, law, sociology, economics, and philosophy. HJD is receptive to a wide array of methodologies. Universities and think tanks form the core readership of HJD. In particular, researchers, teachers and graduate students of International Relations, together with educators and trainees on programs in Diplomatic Studies utilize the journal. Secondly, it is a journal for all those with an interest or stake in first-rate articles on all aspects of diplomacy, not least the world’s foreign ministries and diplomatic academies. Jan Melissen and Paul Sharp are the journal's founding co-editors.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=7100153136&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=7100153136\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The aim of the journal is to provide a platform for scientists to disseminate recent results of applied plant research in the fields of e.g. plant physiology and plant ecology, plant biotechnology, plant breeding and cultivation, phytomedicine, plant nutrition, plant stress and resistance, plant microbiology, plant analysis (including -omics techniques), and plant food chemistry. Within these fields, manuscripts are expected to have a clear focus on botanical and plant quality aspects and to contain new and innovative information based on state-of-the-art methodologies. Authors should clearly state and evaluate their specific research hypotheses and place their results into a conceptual framework. Research results must have general applications, should not be of a pure corroborative nature and should not be of only local significance. Novelty and significance of the work should be adequately discussed by the authors. JABFQ will publish articles on the application of a standard method on a new species or cultivar only, if the results are critically evaluated and put into context to already published studies. Contributions which emphasize pure agronomic research related to the fields above and which describe food processing technologies or research on medical plants with a focus on pharmaceutical rather than on botanical aspects are unsuitable for publication. Accepted papers will be published online after typesetting usually 6 to 8 weeks after acceptance and are freely accessible for everyone. JABFQ publishes original articles and reviews.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=98776&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=98776\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The aim of this journal is to expand our knowledge of sexual health with a particular focus on understanding problematic/compulsive sexual behaviors across diverse clinical and non-clinical populations. Specifically, the journal will offer a broad perspective of sexual health with a strong focus on compulsive sexual behaviors and their co-occurrence with other addictive and mental health disorders in clinical and non-clinical populations. Furthermore, the journal will cover topics ranging from behavioral, epidemiological, and neurobiological methods used to assess factors that contribute to the development and treatment of sexual behaviors including compulsive sexual behaviors (often known as sexual addiction, sexual compulsivity, and hypersexual disorder/hypersexuality). Conceptual issues regarding addiction, compulsivity, and sexual medicine will be explored as new research emerges, and its relevance for developing new treatment approaches for problematic/compulsive sexual behaviors.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101089135&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101089135\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Although one purpose of the journal is to deal with the well-known classical aspects of bone and mineral physiology, the journal’s unique character is to highlight information about the advancing field of molecular medicine, which now finds linkages between this classical field and disease states that in the past were considered distinct. For example, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis share many biochemical pathways. New molecular tools show common pathways with bone physiology and obesity, diabetes mellitus, and energy metabolism. The focus on the novel is a major aspect of this journal’s purpose. The rapid developments in the field needs to be represented in a comprehensive way in order to keep students, clinicians and researchers up-to date. In order to assure that all latest developments are covered, the journal publishes, not only, unsolicited reviews, but also invited reviews on most important topics as well.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29293&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

Krisis is a platform for original articles, essays and book reviews with regards to social, cultural and political thought. Krisis is particularly interested in contributions that employ philosophy in understanding current societal, cultural and political developments. Over the last 35 years, Krisis has always published original contributions in political and social philosophy, cultural theory, philosophies of media, science and technology, and empirical philosophy, which was partly created in the Netherlands. Krisis has, from its early beginnings, played an important part in introducing new, upcoming thinkers in the Netherlands. Theorists such as Etienne Balibar, Seyla Benhabib, Jodi Dean, Sally Haslanger, Axel Honneth and Bruno Latour published with Krisis. On the basis of its open-access platform Krisis offers a space for philosophers working in the Netherlands but also for a widening, international public. Krisis publishes in Dutch and in English. Krisis want to enable serious, theoretical reflection in view of increasing academic internationalisation. This reflection does not detach itself from societal and political contexts. Apart from being a peer-reviewed journal that maintains high academic standards, Krisis is a forum current and critical engagement with public issues. Meaning: Krisis stands in a European philosophical tradition that takes its public task seriously. It won’t forget her naïve ambition to create clarity in public debate. Krisis will therefore uphold an active role in a range of public debates, in the Netherlands and elsewhere.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=20000195031&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=20000195031\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

É um periódico multidisciplinar no campo das ciências humanas que segue uma definição estrita de multidisciplinaridade, privilegiando contribuições substantivas em seu campo. Ocasionalmente, acolhe artigos oriundos de outras áreas, quando claramente dedicados a travar interlocução com a produção de conhecimento nas ciências sociais. Publicada ininterruptamente durante todos esses anos, nasceu e desenvolveu seu perfil editorial ao longo do tempo como periódico da Anpocs. A partir do número 90, publicado em fevereiro de 2016, passou a circular apenas em formato digital. Os artigos da revista se encontram disponíveis, em acesso aberto, tanto no SciELO quanto na página institucional da Anpocs, no canal Publicações, bem como em algumas redes acadêmicas.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4700152250&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=4700152250\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Researchers and analysts within these traditions seek to understand how political, economic and cultural processes and struggles interact to shape and reshape the conditions of people's lives. Established in 1979, SPE has, as a Political Economy Journal, become a major forum for people who identify with the struggles to overcome exploitation, exclusion and oppression in Canada and abroad. SPE is especially interested in work by, for and about Canadians, but it aims to be an international Political Economy journal. It welcomes contributions in every field of political economy and within all the traditions of socialist scholarship, including those which question established paradigms. Those who pursue progressive work within different frameworks will find SPE a venue for communicating with a wide and diversified audience. In addition to articles, Studies in Political Economy publishes interviews, short essays on contemporary political issues, review essays and comments on articles it has published.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=13924&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=13924\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It publishes papers that pay special attention to the economics of emerging economies, but is open to high-quality papers from all fields of applied economics. Empirical papers with significant policy implications are preferred, particularly papers with evidence-based policy analysis that apply modern quantitative techniques to sound data sets. At the same time, high-quality review articles are not excluded. The journal appeals to a broad international audience, and hence, empirical papers that cover a range of countries or analyse topics that are relevant outside a single country are often chosen. NCAER’s location, the rising global interest in India, and the growing size of India’s global presence mean that the journal inevitably carries some papers that explore the economics of the major economic, demographic, and social transformation that India is undergoing.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100857165&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100857165\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Driven by a group of recognised experts worldwide, AsiaIntervention is an international, English language, peer-reviewed journal whose aim is to create a forum of high-quality research and educational articles in the field of percutaneous and surgical cardiovascular interventions with particular emphasis on scientific contributions from the Asia-Pacific region. More specifically, AsiaIntervention offers peer reviewed original research to the readers. The Journal publishes clinical research articles, expert reviews, special reports, short reports, editorials and images in cardiology. All of these articles are reviewed by the editorial board and selected expert reviewers in Interventional Cardiology. The review process of AsiaIntervention is a single-blind peer review process. AsiaIntervention’s Board comprises of editors from renowned institutions in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, providing the Journal with a diverse range of expertise and independence. The Editor in Chief is supported by Deputy Editors and Associate Editors who are also recognised in their respective fields. AsiaIntervention releases two issues per year in both print and electronic formats and is indexed in MEDLINE®/PubMed Central®. The Journal has recently applied for indexation in Web of Science® and Scopus. Although there are a number of journals in the Asia-Pacific region, either in native languages or in English, none are dedicated to publishing work in the interventional cardiology field, with articles primarily originating from this region. For this reason, AsiaIntervention was launched. Alongside its formidable economic development, the Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for over 60% of the world’s population, has experienced the most rapid expansion in interventional cardiology worldwide.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101128172&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101128172\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Upon its acceptance the paper is categorized as follows: original scientific paper, preliminary communication, subject review or professional paper. Original scientific papers should report about original theoretical or practical research results. The given data must be sufficient in order to enable the experiment to be repeated with all effects described by the author, measurement results, or theoretical calculations. Preliminary communication present one or more new scientific results but without details that allow the reported data to be checked. The papers of this category inform about experimental research, small research projects, or progress reports that are of interest. Subject reviews cover the state-of-art and tendencies in the development of a specific theory, technology and application with given remarks by the author. Such a paper ends with a list of references with all the necessary items in the related field. Professional papers report on the original design of an instrument, device, or equipment not necessarily resulting from the original research.

It also provides a forum for internal medicine doctors where they can share new approaches with the aim of improving diagnostic and clinical skills in this field. EJCRIM welcomes high-quality case reports describing unusual or complex cases that an internist may encounter in everyday practice. The cases should either demonstrate the appropriateness of a diagnostic/therapeutic approach, describe a new procedure or maneuver, or show unusual manifestations of a disease or unexpected reactions. The Journal only accepts and publishes those case reports whose learning points provide new insight and/or contribute to advancing medical knowledge both in terms of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches. Case reports of medical errors, therefore, are also welcome as long as they provide innovative measures on how to prevent them in the current practice (Instructive Errors).

Social Work is a line of work carried out by trained professionals, or \"Social Workers\", in many different countries. Accordingly, the nature of social work can vary widely. However, its broad aim is to assess and meet people's social needs by providing services that enable them to live in safety, independence and dignity. In order to appropriately cater to the needs of the people they serve, the practices, aims and values of Social Workers must reflect the cultural and social norms of the society in which they operate. Comparative social work emphasizes comparative studies of social work between different countries, cultures and contexts. The journal aims to support practitioners and academics alike through its discussions of matters relevant to Social Work Practice. This journal publishes two types of peer-reviewed scientific articles on subjects of importance for social work, with a special emphasis on comparative research on different aspects. This includes: -Comparative studies -Single site studies that also generate insight and knowledge in various geographical/cultural and national settings. We also welcome essays discussing/reflecting relevant subjects from an individual point of view, and at least two members of our editorial board will review such papers (maximum of 3,000 words). The JCSW was founded in 2006 and is currently hosted by the University of Stavanger, in cooperation with the University of Agder and the University of Nordland.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100828754&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100828754\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Se trata de una publicación digital de Ciencias Sociales e investigación social de caracter trimestral, organizada en torno a un contenido temático por número. La Revista Prisma Social nació en diciembre de 2008 con la vocación de difundir y expandir la investigación de los fenómenos sociales, pues saber más de las necesidades, aspiraciones, sentimientos y pensamientos de las personas, es saber más del mundo. El objetivo principal de la Revista está orientado a la difusión de las investigaciones provenientes de las Ciencias Sociales y caracterizadas fundamentalmente por el factor de innovación social. Se pretende que la Revista integre la facilidad y accesibilidad propia de los medios de comunicación social y científica, con la precisión y el rigor que precisan los resultados de la investigación, de tal forma que sea útil a la sociedad y atractiva a los receptores sin perder la fuerza de la expresión ni el rigor científico. Así, se busca ofrecer una nueva perspectiva de análisis de la realidad que proporcione respuestas a los interrogantes que la sociedad se plantea. Se trata de un espacio de reflexión y difusión de investigaciones que profundizan en el origen y las causas de los fenómenos sociales.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100264820&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100264820\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Although it is true that there is no real science without speculative reflection and that «science must not succumb to the bare necessities of practice», it is also true that science should not be a stronghold or a product for scientists; speculation is not exclusive to doctors and science should be placed at the service of practice.

CEJISS is a pluralist journal. It favours a variety of theories and methods used as well as topics and geographical areas covered. Nonetheless, CEJISS is primarily (but not exclusively) interested in drivers of the contemporary world’s change – from geopolitical shifts, nationalist resurgence and regionalisation to environmental and technological changes. Rather than specialising in a particular theme, it prefers to understand the broader impacts and mutual entanglements of these processes. CEJISS publishes articles focused on Central and Eastern Europe, the region of its primary focus, as well as on other regions and the global international system. It is open to inter-disciplinary, cross-thematic and trans-regional works discussing international aspects of politics and security. CEJISS also welcomes policy-relevant articles.

Geology has no boundaries so we may publish papers on any area of knowledge that is interesting to our readers. We also favor the publication of papers on relatively unfamiliar subjects and objectives in mainstream journals, e.g., papers devoted to new methodologies or their improvement, and areas of knowledge that in the past had relatively little attention paid them in Mexican journals, such as urban geology, water management, environmental geology, and ore deposits, among others. Mexico is a land of volcanos, earthquakes, vast resources in minerals and petroleum, and a shortage of water. Consequently, these topics should certainly be of major interest to our readers, our Society, and society in general. Furthermore, the Boletín has been published since 1904; that makes it one of the oldest scientific journals currently active in Mexico and, most notably, its entire contents, from the first issue on, are available online.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15600154707&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15600154707\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The editors welcome the following submissions: Research Articles: These should be essays of 8,000 to 10,000 words, which use primary source research to make new arguments, engage with scholarship in the field, and which deal with time (change or continuity), causation and causality, context (historical and historiographical), and complexity. Pedagogical Articles: These essays reflect on teaching practices and strategies related to interdisciplinary food courses, such as assignments, syllabi, and class experiences in kitchen laboratories. These are generally about 4,000 to 6,000 words. Review Articles: These essays are typically historiographical in nature or else think pieces on trends within subfields of food history. The word count may vary from a long book review to a full-length research article, but the length should reflect the scope of the topic. Archival Articles: These essays should provide context for and analyze specific recipes, primary sources, or archival collections. For publishing primary sources, the editors prefer that the source should be historically significant, previously unpublished, and ideally of pedagogical value. The journal has a strong preference for translations into English. Such documents must include an introduction putting the source into context as well as critical apparatus in the footnotes. Total word count should not exceed that for other types of submissions. The translator/editor must obtain all necessary reprint rights prior to consideration.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101163290&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101163290\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The impact of global imperatives on the lives of children has been significant. The experiences of childhood that take place within the situated spaces of geographic locales and culturally specific frames of reference are subject to global forces that complicate, disrupt and reconfigure the meanings associated with childhood/s on the local and global stage. Our conceptualisation of childhood refers to a socially constructed category whose parameters are not necessarily fixed by factors such as biological development or chronological age. GSC is therefore interested in issues that pertain to childhood, here broadly conceived, and the challenges these pose to children’s lives and futures in an increasingly complex world. Issues around what constitutes childhood are therefore fundamental to discussions, as are ways in which we need to ensure that all children have basic human rights and are protected from exploitation. We are therefore interested and concerned about the lives of children, young people and young adults in a globalised context. In canvassing and promoting quality research we hope to be better able to understand childhoods and extend our notions about the ways in which Global Studies of Childhood can make a contribution to educational, cultural and social theory in strategic and significant ways. GSC will enable the significant issues to be showcased and interrogated in a dedicated space. This will include interdisciplinary research, using various research design and methodologies. The Editors and Editorial Advisory Board encourage the submission of a relevant high quality manuscripts that will include: reports of research and conceptual pieces; commentaries on published research articles, literature reviews; book reviews; colloquia and from time to time we will commission special editions and commentaries.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100894548&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100894548\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Each issue of Creative Nursing brings readers insights into topics of interest to health care professionals from various practice settings. Creative Nursing is edited by health care professionals who love our professions and have a vision for their future. Article submissions from all walks of life are welcome and will receive respectful consideration. We strive to foster diverse perspectives and experiences, and invite contributors with unique insights, backgrounds, and expertise to join this inclusive dialogue. We especially welcome submissions from novice authors, and work with them to prepare robust, scholarly content. Articles accepted for potential publication undergo blinded review by independent content experts who hold advanced degrees in nursing or relevant related fields. The name of our journal reflects our historical origin as a publication about Primary Nursing, but we encourage and publish interprofessional articles from all health care disciplines around the world.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27627&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=27627\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It was founded in 2005 by a group of young researchers (PhD and PhD candidates) that recognize the necessity to create a new peer reviewed scientific journal in Romania. They also recognized the need of giving possibility for researchers to publish their research quickly, and in visible way. Since its formation, North-West.J.Zool. make the papers published available online without fee. North-West.J.Zool. is currently published two times every year (in June and December) but the editors are working in the possibility for increasing the number of issues to three per year. This will moreover depend on the number of high quality manuscripts submitted.

To become a member, please click here to view the current options. The primary editorial goal of Theology and Science is to publish critically reviewed articles that promote the creative mutual interaction between the natural sciences and theology. While the journal assumes the integrity of each domain, its primary aim is to explore this interaction in terms of the implications of the natural sciences for constructive research in philosophical and systematic theology, the philosophical and theological elements within and underlying theoretical research in the natural sciences, and the relations and interactions between theological and scientific methodologies. The secondary editorial goal is to monitor and critically assess debates and controversies arising in the broader field of science and religion. Thus, Theology and Science will investigate, analyze, and report on issues as they arise with the intention of prompting further academic discussion of them.This editorial policy is formulated with the guiding confidence that a serious dialogue between science and theology will lead to a variety of new and progressive research programs, and that these in turn will yield new insights, deeper understanding, and new knowledge at the frontiers of science and religion.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Multidisciplinary","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=6500153124&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

The journal provides a communication forum to advance entrepreneurship, innovation, small business management and family business theory, as well as the application thereof in practice. Its aim is the improvement and further development of these fields and it is designed to appeal to both practitioners and academics. A double-blind review process is followed, supported by a national and international Editorial Review Board. The mission of the SAJESBM is to publish empirical and theoretical contributions in the form of fieldwork, laboratory, case-studies, qualitative, quantitative, or conceptual papers. The significance of the findings is applied as relevant and functional in the entrepreneurial and management fields. It is envisaged that the SAJESBM will serve as a platform in which information central to the concerns of practitioners and academics is presented.

Launched in 1994, the journal is published in both print and digital formats (available at the SciELO portal: www.scielo.br/hcsm) and is indexed in Brazil and abroad. The essence of the journal is captured by the words “history,” “science,” and “health.” HCSM’s concept of history reflects a perspective and a way of observing, interpreting, and addressing things that is common to a gamut of academic fields and professionals. Although the life sciences are its key focus, the journal also opens its pages to fields of knowledge that share ties with the historical approach. In its print version, the journal’s graphic project incorporates architectural elements from the Moorish castle known as Manguinhos – the historic landmark in Brazilian science from which the journal derives its name and which is home to the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. In recent years, in addition to architectural details from the castle, our covers have featured photographs, paintings, and illustrations of subjects presented in the pages of our journal. HCSM endeavors to bring together readers and contributors from an array of fields – for example, history, medicine, sociology, public health, anthropology, and philosophy – all of whom share a commitment to today’s notable trend to eliminate the barriers between diverse forms of knowledge. HCSM publishes original articles and research notes, documents and images of historical value, debates, interviews, book reviews, and digital production of relevance to the history of science and health.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=14784&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=14784\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal publishes either thematic issues devoted to the key historiographical debates of today or regular issues which are divded into three parts, each with its own distinct features: -Part I contains articles based on original research, which also consider questions of wider interest, whether of theory, historiography, methodology or comparison. -Part II consists of reviews and review articles, intended to spread knowledge of the latest work across Europe and thus to open up national historiographies. -Part III aims to help researchers practically, by providing information about grants, achives, university networks, centres of research, conferences and similar matters. Thematic issues are guest edited but submitted to the same anonymous external refereeing process as regular issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"History","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=82562&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=82562\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The global project of public theology has expanded the western idea of three audiences - the church, the academy and the public domain – and their inter-relationship to multiple publics. It has now become a global discipline that intersects with the emergence of a world Christianity. Now, in the Anthropocene, those three audiences should be viewed in the light of a concern for the whole of creation, including those other creatures with whom we share life and upon whom we depend. A public theology seeks to be in creative dialogue with different academic disciplines, including politics, economics, law and security studies, cultural studies, religion, spirituality, the natural science and the social sciences and the study of globalization. It is sensitive to the emergence of new publics that arise out of theology’s engagement with other new disciplines – like astrobiology – which redefines understandings of what is space and what is public. It is also a discipline that welcomes the expertise of practitioners reflecting on public policy.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100285458&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100285458\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

International Journal of Semantic Computing (IJSC) addresses the computing technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, natural language, software engineering, data and knowledge engineering, computer systems, signal processing, etc.), and their interactions, that may be used to extract or process computational content and descriptions. While some areas of Semantic Computing have appeared as isolated pieces in journals dedicated to individual disciplines, IJSC is a journal that glues these pieces together into an integrated theme with synergetic interactions. It addresses not only the analysis and transformation of signals (e.g., pixels, words) into useful information, but also how such information can be synthesized and accessed. IJSC publishes regular papers, review papers, case studies, tutorials, communications, book reviews, conference reports, industry trends, and product reviews.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100872796&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100872796\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Legal/statutory requirements of Boards- Values, actions, behaviours of business leaders- Strategies for effective stakeholder governance- Stakeholder accounting/measurement of business actions- Ethics

Depending on the subject, articles will be published in Italian or English in order to achieve this two-fold objective. The journal is peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary in scope, and it hopes to foster a fruitful dialogue between scholars, on the one hand, and policy makers, on the other. Contributions combine a sound theoretical framework together with rigorous empirical analysis on a wide range of social policy issues which includes: poverty and social exclusion, education, training and labour market policies; family policies, health and social care services; aging and pensions, gender and migration. Of specific interest are cross-national studies which focus on the public/private mix in social provision, Europeanisation processes and also the interaction between national, sub-national and supra-national levels of government in Southern Europe. Journal issues feature two briefing sections. One specifically for Italian issues, devoted to the latest and most important social policy developments in the country. The other on European matters, focused on topical EU level decisions that are relevant for social protection systems and the social dimension of the European integration process. Articles should be submitted in either Italian or English and will be selected for publication as a result of a strict double-blind peer-review process.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100843483&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100843483\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Recognizing the vitality of debates about change in the fourth and fifth centuries, and conscious of the artificiality of the boundaries associated with 1492, we encourage submission of all innovative scholarship of interest to the community of medievalists and Iberianists. JMIS , which aims to bring theoretically informed approaches into creative contact with more empirically minded scholarship,encompasses archaeology, art and architecture, music, philosophy and religious studies, as well as history, codicology, manuscript studies and the multiple Arabic, Latin, Romance, and Hebrew linguistic and literary traditions of Iberia. We welcome work that engages peninsular Iberia in relation to other parts of the ‘post-classical’ world; which explores links of colonization and exchange with the Maghreb, embraces the study of Occitania, addresses Iberia’s presence in the Mediterranean, or adopts a transatlantic or Latin American frame. We also encourage interdisciplinary work combining radically different forms of sources or theoretical proposals, and ‘unconventional’ types of submissions including brief opinion pieces or archival reports, individual or clustered interviews with prominent scholars, audio clips, ‘podcasts’, and video files.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700201461&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700201461\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Round Table has for many years been a repository of informed scholarship, opinion, and judgement regarding both international relations in general, and the Commonwealth in particular, with authorship and readership drawn from the worlds of government, business, finance and academe. Recent themed issues have dealt with Australia, Zimbabwe, and the situation of sub-national island jurisdictions. These have been followed by issues on France, the Middle East, Nigeria, development and 'remembrance', all with a distinctly Commonwealth emphasis but one that also will appeal to a wider readership.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27979&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=27979\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Conceived as a conference proceedings volume, edited and published by the organizers of the successive paleontological symposia held under the auspices of the Romanian Society of Paleontologists (RSP), Acta Palaeontologica Romaniae continued its biannual apparitions in parallel with the symposia taking place in Cluj, Iasi, and Bucharest, respectively; in 2011, it reached its 7th published volume. At the latest, 8th National Symposium on Paleontology, organised in Bucharest in september 2011, a decision was reached by the members of the RSP to transform the proceedings volume into a regular journal with 2 issues per year, aiming to breach the limitations of a proceedings volume and to open towards the entire paleontological scientific community, while still offering a publication platform for the papers presented at fortcoming National Symposia. Continuously under the auspices of the Romanian Society of Paleontologists and keeping with its former profile, the new journal Acta Palaeontologica Romaniae is poised to publish papers in the wider areas of Paleontology and Paleoecology, as well as in such related topics as Stratigraphy, Sedimentology, or Geological Heritage Concervation. In order to accomplish this aim, a new, permanent Editorial Team, supported by an international Editorial Board, was formed, covering a wide range of paleontological disciplines. Papers will be published, just as in the previous proceedings volumes, following a rigurous peer-review process in order to raise the content of the journal to higher international standards.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Stratigraphy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Stratigraphy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Stratigraphy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101056813&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101056813\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In many marketing and management cases, relationships are the cornerstone for high performance, productive and efficient exchange. The contexts for such relationships include supply chain relationships, marketing channel relationships, third-party relationships, business-to-business relationships, regulatory relationships, strategic partnerships, export/import relationships, intermediary relationships, and intra-organizational relationships between groups, departments, or divisions. The common themes that will drive JIOR are the theories, rather than the context, that explain relationships. These include, but are not limited to, transaction cost economics, agency theory, trust, commitment theory, control theory, stewardship theory, governance theory, power-dependence theory, and the study of contracts, both written and psychological. Contributions to new inter-organization theories are welcome. Such theories can be applied to a variety of topics in marketing and management including relationship eco-systems and platforms, inter-group conflict, contract negotiations, relational business models, relationship formation and dissolution, the dark side of trust-based relationships, issues of control and coordination, the effects of technology on decision making, power imbalances, adverse selection and moral hazard, incentives, monitoring, contract enforcement, legal remedies, diversity of goals, internal organizational issues, control-trust dynamics, relational exchange, inter-group communication strategies, sales force relationships, goal misalignment, calculative trust and calculative commitment, and substitution and complementation of control processes.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101125547&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101125547\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

JAAH provides a vehicle for high quality research and forward-thinking scholarly activity embracing multifaceted understandings of aesthetic modes of engagement.

It originated as the Archiv für Religionspsychologie in 1914, establishing it as the oldest periodical in the field. This English-language journal publishes three issues per year, with articles appearing online before the editors assign them to an issue. Psychological theories, principles, and applications form the core emphases of the journal. Contributions are welcomed when they are thoroughly grounded in either quantitative or qualitative methodologies. Ideally, articles are historically situated, critical, and generative. Likewise, given the journal’s global mission, submissions that clearly articulate and represent diverse cultural perspectives are highly valued. Articles that utilize insights from other disciplines are encouraged to the extent that those observations promote more thorough understandings of central psychological elements. Multiple submission types are possible within three primary sections: Theory (major reviews, conceptual development), Research (theory testing, reports), and Pedagogy (tutorials, historical notes). The Archive contains both invited and submitted material, including occasional target articles and responses. Authors may propose Special Issues to the Editor at any time.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology

The journal focuses on the comparison of political cultures of Central and Eastern European countries, their practical policy, theoretical questions of comparative political science, theoretical and practical questions of the development of civil society and civil policy in this region. Two principal aims animate the Journal of Comparative Politics: to provide its readers promptly with the best work being done in political science, (1) on the central and currently controversial themes of the discipline, and, (2) in new areas of inquiry where political scientists – alone or in conjunction with other scholars – are shaping innovative concepts and methodologies of political analysis.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100846340&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100846340\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It serves three large communities: (1) Students, scholars and practitioners of spirituality as pertaining to management and organizations, (2) Management academics and practising managers, (3) Scholars in religion studies and of religious affairs. JMSR serves as a meeting forum and fosters cross-fertilisation in these communities. It wishes to encompass, without prejudging any belief or none, a multitude of interests and concerns. Our sole criterion is academic rigour and scientific merit. It seeks to define the field through conceptual, theoretical and empirical understandings of MSR that include: • Examining MSR through different traditions • Exploring the relationship between MSR and society • Critical and interdisciplinary work that may extend the boundaries of MSR • Metaphysical explanations of MSR We are the prime dedicated academic forum for disseminating work, for the development of theory, for reporting best practice, and for the exchange of ideas and debate in Management, Spirituality and Religion. We pledge to continue and be the recognized leaders in this field of study.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100201981&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100201981\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In the introduction to the first issue, John Dewey observed that “the hostile state of the world and the intellectual division that has been built up in so-called ‘social science,’ are … reflections and expressions of the same fundamental causes.” Dewey commended this journal for its intention to promote “synthesis in the social field.” Dewey wrote those words almost six decades after the social science associations split off from the American Historical Association in pursuit of value-free knowledge derived from specialized disciplines. Since he wrote them, academic or disciplinary specialization has become even more pronounced. Multi-disciplinary work is superficially extolled in major universities, but practices and incentives still favor highly specialized work. The result is that academia has become a bastion of analytic excellence, breaking phenomena into components for intensive investigation, but it contributes little synthetic or holistic understanding that can aid society in finding solutions to contemporary problems. Analytic work remains important, but in response to the current lop-sided emphasis on specialization, the board of AJES has decided to return to its roots by emphasizing a more integrated and practical approach to knowledge.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18299&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18299\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It is published four-times a year, always at the end of the corresponding quarter. The first special issue was presented to the reading public in 1990; the first periodic issue was published in 1991. Journal of Ethnology began as a free instalment of a professional journal that was published between 1964 and 1990 under the name Ethnographic News. After November 1989, the journal was modified: not only its name but also its content and format changed. With new graphic appearance and manifold content, the editors at that time aimed to disseminate the contemporary ethnological investigation more distinctly and so to extend the group of the reading public. Nevertheless, the journal made again a name for itself as a professional periodical focused on the ethnologic (and the resulting interdisciplinary) problems within social and historical contexts. The main intention of the editors is to reflect the discipline as flexibly as possible. The Journal of Ethnology presents the themes in the field of traditional culture and researches within the contemporary society; it reflects the live research terrain that brings new initiatives for the discipline. In the above connections, it pays attention also to folklorism and to the tasks investigated by the National Institute of Folk Culture that is the publisher of the journal. In addition to studies and material papers in Czech and Slovak languages (the studies by foreign authors, written in other languages, are translated into Czech), the journal publishes also the theme photographic enclosures documenting the ethnographic photography in the last century predominantly (the section Stopping with Photos).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100783506&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100783506\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Reading values broadly, the journal seeks to encourage and foster a meaningful conversation among scholars for whom values are no esoteric resources to be archived uncritically from the past. Moving beyond cultural boundaries, the Journal looks at values as something that animates the contemporary in its myriad manifestations: politics and public affairs, business and corporations, global institutions and local organisations, and the personal and the private.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cultural

Molecular Astrophysics is a peer-reviewed journal containing full research articles, selected review articles, and thematic issues. Molecular Astrophysics is a new journal where researchers working in planetary and exoplanetary science, astrochemistry, astrobiology, spectroscopy, physical chemistry and chemical physics can meet and exchange their ideas. Understanding the origin and evolution of interstellar and circumstellar molecules is key to understanding the Universe around us and our place in it and has become a fundamental goal of modern astrophysics. Molecular Astrophysics aims to provide a platform for scientists studying the chemical processes that form and dissociate molecules, and control chemical abundances in the universe, particularly in Solar System objects including planets, moons, and comets, in the atmospheres of exoplanets, as well as in regions of star and planet formation in the interstellar medium of galaxies. Observational studies of the molecular universe are driven by a range of new space missions and large-scale scale observatories opening up. With the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Herschel Space Observatory, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), NASA's Kepler mission, the Rosetta mission, and more major future facilities such as NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and various missions to Mars, the journal taps into the expected new insights and the need to bring the various communities together on one platform. The journal aims to cover observational, laboratory as well as computational results in the galactic, extragalactic and intergalactic areas of our universe.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100443326&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100443326\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

However, why we sleep remains unclear and it is one of the enigmas of modern neuroscience. Sleep loss and sleep deprivation has deleterious consequences. Many research laboratories across the globe evaluate sleep at the intersection between the cellular and the systems level. Such approaches are needed to understand the purpose of sleep. Within the sleep field, several of the predictions and hypotheses are often explored using simple to complex animal models, high-density EEG, and other synthetic approaches such as a large-scale computational simulation of multiple brain regions. Understanding how brain activity across behavioral states provide a conscious experience, which has pivotal implications for several clinical fields such as translational neuroscience, neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology. This is a rapidly growing area with a wide research base, yet currently has no dedicated journal. To fill the void, this is where the proposed journal 'Vigilance' comes into picture. Vigilance will provide such unique platform to collect and disseminate state-of-the art scientific understanding on research in the increasingly overlapping fields of basic, translational and clinical sleep medicine. Vigilance will be a a Springer owned journal in collaboration and editorial support from the Indian Society for Sleep Research (ISSR), which aims to publish exemplary peer-reviewed manuscripts directing neurobiological investigation related to normal and altered vigilance states. Vigilance will be a broad-spectrum international scholarly journal, which aims to publish rigorously peer-reviewed, high quality research manuscripts within the biomedical as well as clinical research under one roof so that the translational research in sleep medicine can be nurtured and promoted.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101023029&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101023029\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is fundamentally different from many journals of numerical analysis, computational analysis, and algorithms. The acceptance of papers is judged on the use of mathematical techniques and/or engineering methodology in the computational analysis and simulations of complex industrial and real life problems in the above areas. Articles describing carefully tested computational techniques, including post-processing visualisation, for real life problems are welcome on the basis of the above criteria. Articles involving numerical or mathematical analysis must be driven by applications with industrial and real life problems or their simplified versions.

Unlike other journals that focus either on space science or on space technologies, it intends to bridge the two communities of space science and technologies, by providing opportunities to exchange ideas and viewpoints in a single journal. Topics suitable for publication in JASS include researches in the following fields: space astronomy, solar physics, magnetospheric and ionospheric physics, cosmic ray, space weather, and planetary sciences; space instrumentation, satellite dynamics, geodesy, spacecraft control, and spacecraft navigation. However, the topics covered by JASS are not restricted to those mentioned above as the journal also encourages submission of research results in all other branches related to space science and technologies. Even though JASS was established on the heritage and achievements of the Korean space science community, it is now open to the worldwide community, while maintaining a high standard as a leading international journal. Hence, it solicits papers from the international community with a vision of global collaboration in the fields of space science and technologies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100201037&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100201037\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It publishes work on the theory, methods, practice, and history of the social sciences in English, French, or German.

In particular, it covers the following topics: a) Public policies and citizen participation. Proper water management is the main tool for solving water supply and sanitation problems in today’s society. In this area, the social participation and citizen movements are perceived as the element capable of countering the environmental and social conflicts that arise around water. The study of water companies, their evolution and the assessment of their levels of failure and success also occupy an important place in this line of research. b) Water as a natural resource: development and environmental models. The accelerated industrial, urban and demographic development of the past two centuries has been a major challenge in preserving the quality of water and its natural environments. It has also had to deal with the major problem of supplying drinking water to a growing population and counteracting the polluting potential of water. c) Water and landscape. Water has shaped human events since prehistoric times and has also shaped the rural landscape in a characteristic way. Water landscapes are a clear example of the multiple facets of water as a configurator of territories in which cultures that have left their mark on the landscape have developed.[...]","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101063015&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101063015\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal’s scope encompasses all nonlinear dynamic phenomena associated with mechanical, structural, civil, aeronautical, oceanography, electrical, and control systems. We particularly welcome papers in the fields of celestial mechanics, mathematical physics, high-energy astrophysics, astrophysical studies of the interstellar medium, planetary and space science. Review articles and original contributions are based on analytical, computational, and experimental methods. Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences (AMNS) is dedicated to the publication of the highest quality short papers, regular papers, and expository papers. AMNS considers only original and timely contributions containing new results in various fields of Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences. Manuscripts may discuss fundamental or applied issues, and should offer clear evidence of novelty and significance. Papers devoted, for the most part, to pure mathematical and computational issues, with limited direct connection to current trends of nonlinear sciences research, are generally not suitable for publication in AMNS. Similarly, small, technical advances, or papers concerned only with mathematical applications or issues of basic science may not be considered favourably. AMNS publishes two issues per year in a continous model - issue 1 is opened in January and closed at the end of June, issue 2 is opened in July and closed at the end of December.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101021773&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101021773\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In these areas problems are often multiphysics and have important features at multiple scales, particularly multiple spatial scales. Multiscale Modelling is an international peer-reviewed journal that presents forefront fundamental works in the above field of research. It features timely scientific reports of advances in modelling and computation, theoretical breakthroughs and also contains interesting review articles about emerging issues. Multiscale Modelling provides a common platform for exchange of views and presentation of original papers (theoretical, computational and experimental) with a general emphasis on Multiscale issues in this rapidly developing field. Papers reporting advancement of the theory and applications of single scale problems (i.e. Nano, Micro, etc.) which pave the way for multiscale implementation are also appropriate for the journal. Research areas of interest include for example multiscale modelling and computation in: composite and polymer materials, crystalline microstructures, nanomaterials, opto electronics for the development of materials with particular optical, magnetic and electrical properties, flow through porous media, dendritic solidification, turbulent transport in high Reylonds number flows, spray combustion, large-scale molecular dynamic simulation, environmental applications such as separation of gas, toxicological properties, environmental impact, chemistry and biological systems.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900193684&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900193684\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We are particularly interested in papers that: assess the Social Security retirement, survivors, and disability programs and the economic security of the aged; evaluate changing economic, demographic, health, and social factors affecting work/retirement decisions and retirement savings; consider the uncertainties that individuals and households face in preparing for and during retirement and the tools available to manage such uncertainties; and measure the changing characteristics and economic circumstances of SSI beneficiaries.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16835&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16835\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

These practices include, for instance, political, legal, medical, financial, commercial, academic, educational, problem-solving, and interpersonal communication.

Responding to the need for a rigorous, in-depth review of current work in its field, Museum Worlds: Advances in Research contributes to the ongoing formation of Museum Studies as an academic and practical area of research that is rapidly expanding and alive with potential, opportunity, and challenge that parallels the rapid growth of museums in just about every part of the world. Museum Worlds aims to trace and comment on major regional, theoretical, methodological, and topical themes and debates, and to encourage comparison of museum theories, practices, and developments in different global settings. Each issue includes a conversation piece on a current topic, as well as peer-reviewed scholarly articles and review articles, book and exhibition reviews, and news on developments in museum studies and related curricula in different parts of the world. Drawing on the expertise and networks of a global Editorial Board of senior scholars and museum practitioners, the journal both challenges and develops the core concepts that link different disciplinary perspectives on museums by bringing new voices into ongoing debates and discussions. Articles are of exceptional quality and general interest from around the world.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Conservation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Conservation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Conservation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Conservation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Conservation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Museology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Museology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Museology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Museology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Museology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101011859&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101011859\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Four types of manuscript are considered for publication: single case investigations that bear directly on issues of relevance to theoretical issues or brain-behavior relationships; group studies of subjects with brain dysfunction that address issues relevant to the understanding of human cognition; reviews of important topics in the domains of neuropsychology, neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology; and brief reports (up to 2500 words) that replicate previous reports dealing with issues of considerable significance. Of particular interest are investigations that include precise anatomical localization of lesions or neural activity via imaging or other techniques, as well as studies of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, since these diseases are becoming more common as our population ages. Topic reviews are included in most issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17468&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17468\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Rapid advances in forensic science have created a need for a review journal to bridge the gap between research-oriented journals and reference volumes. The goal of Forensic Science Review is to fill this void and provide a base for authors to extrapolate state-of-the-art information and to synthesize and translate it into readable review articles. The addition of this journal extends the spectrum of forensic science publications. Articles bring into focus various narrowly defined topics whose literature has been widely scattered. Articles are presented to stimulate further research on one hand and worthwhile technological applications on the other. The publisher’s aim is to provide forensic scientists with a forum enabling them to accomplish this goal. Technological applications based on basic research are emphasized. Articles address techniques now widely used in forensic science as well as innovations holding promise for the future.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100283726&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100283726\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Since then, the Forum has grown into a traditional environmental law journal. DELPF has retained its interdisciplinary roots and presents scholarship that examines environmental issues by drawing on legal, scientific, economic, and public policy resources. DELPF’s affiliations with the Nicholas School for the Environment, the Terry Sanford Institute for Public Policy, and the Law School render it uniquely positioned to adapt to the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of environmental law. DELPF is student-run publication, with staff members from the Law School, the Nicholas School for the Environment, and the Terry Sanford Institute for Public Policy. New journal members, both JD and non-JD, are selected based upon their writing skills, research ability, and interest in both DELPF and environmental policy. DELPF presents an annual symposium each fall that attracts top academics, practitioners, and policy makers from across the nation. Recent symposium topics have included The Future Environmental Agenda: Environmental Law & Policy Issues Facing the Next President and A Charged Atmosphere: The Future of U.S. Policy on Global Warming.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and

The journal aims to foster open debate through criticism, research and commentary from across the social sciences and humanities. It provides a forum for work with a pronounced dialectical approach to social theory and political practice for scholars, public intellectuals, and activists who are interested in Marxism and political-economy. The journal also welcomes submissions from those who wish to be in dialogue or debate with these traditions. Since 1975, Dialectical Anthropology has been dedicated to working towards the transformation of class society through internationalizing conversations that focus on crises of capitalism and the means for social change.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts
