Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, materials lists with supplier information, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, recipes for reagents and solutions, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols in Immunology to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11600154504&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11600154504\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Landscapes are visible and integrative social-ecological systems with variable spatial and temporal dimensions. They have expressive aesthetic, natural, and cultural qualities that are perceived and valued by people in multiple ways and invite actions resulting in landscape change. Landscapes are increasingly urban in nature and ecologically and culturally sensitive to changes at local through global scales. Multiple disciplines and perspectives are required to understand landscapes and align social and ecological values to ensure the sustainability of landscapes. The journal is based on the premise that landscape science linked to planning and design can provide mutually supportive outcomes for people and nature. Landscape science brings landscape ecology and urban ecology together with other disciplines and cross-disciplinary fields to identify patterns and understand social-ecological processes influencing landscape change. Landscape planning brings landscape architecture, urban and regional planning, landscape and ecological engineering, and other practice-oriented fields to bear in processes for identifying problems and analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating desirable alternatives for landscape change. Landscape design brings plans, designs, management prescriptions, policies and other activities and form-giving products to bear in effecting landscape change. The implementation of landscape planning and design also generates new patterns of evidence and hypotheses for further research, providing an integral link with landscape science and encouraging transdisciplinary collaborations to build robust knowledge and problem solving capacity.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management,

It represents a timely effort to establish a seamless perspective on atmospheric flows, on scales from weather to climate (minutes to decades). The scope of the journal includes the following: the dynamics of extreme weather events (case studies and climatological analyses); weather system dynamics in tropical, midlatitude and polar regions; interactions of atmospheric flows with cloud physics and/or radiation; links between the atmospheric water cycle and weather systems; tropical-extratropical and midlatitude-polar interactions; atmospheric teleconnections and stratosphere-troposphere coupling; boundary-layer dynamics and coupling to land, ocean and ice; atmospheric variability and predictability on time scales from minutes to decades; storm track and Hadley cell dynamics; role of atmospheric dynamics in palaeoclimate and climate change projections; and other aspects of weather and climate dynamics. Theoretical studies, idealized numerical studies, full-physics numerical studies, and diagnostic studies using (re)analysis and/or observational data are welcome. The journal is dedicated to promoting studies that advance our understanding of atmospheric dynamics and the implications for weather and climate. Authors should pay particular attention to whether their paper would fit better in other journals published by EGU Publications, such as Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, Climate of the Past, Geoscientific Model Development, Earth System Dynamics, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences, and Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics. The manuscript types considered for peer-reviewed publication are research articles, review articles, and commentaries/replies.

MCP will publish manuscripts that report significant new biological or clinical discoveries underpinned by proteomic observations across all kingdoms of life. Manuscripts must define the biological roles played by the proteins investigated or their mechanisms of action. The journal also emphasizes articles that describe innovative new computational methods and technological advancements that will enable future discoveries. Manuscripts describing such approaches do not have to include a solution to a biological problem, but must demonstrate that the technology works as described, is reproducible and is appropriate to uncover yet unknown protein/proteome function or properties using relevant model systems or publicly available data. Scope: -Fundamental studies in biology, including integrative \"omics\" studies, that provide mechanistic insights -Novel experimental and computational technologies -Proteogenomic data integration and analysis that enable greater understanding of physiology and disease processes -Pathway and network analyses of signaling that focus on the roles of post-translational modifications -Studies of proteome dynamics and quality controls, and their roles in disease -Studies of evolutionary processes effecting proteome dynamics, quality and regulation -Chemical proteomics, including mechanisms of drug action -Proteomics of the immune system and antigen presentation/recognition -Microbiome proteomics, host-microbe and host-pathogen interactions, and their roles in health and disease -Clinical

This high-profile journal, OncoImmunology specifically deals with tumor immunology. Recent progress has allowed for the first clinical demonstration (and FDA approval) of anticancer immunotherapies. There is also an ever-growing suspicion that - unexpectedly - many of the currently used chemotherapeutic agents depend in their efficacy on the active contribution of immune effectors. To use a drastic metaphor, oncologists who applied successful chemotherapeutic (or radiotherapeutic) regimens have taken advantage of the immune system's capacity to recognize tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens and to control cancer (stem) cell growth, without being aware of the invisible helping hands. As a result, immunological biomarkers are becoming ever more important to determine the prognosis of cancers and to predict the efficacy of chemotherapies. There is also a strong rationale in favor of combining conventional anticancer therapies with immunotherapies. OncoImmunology accepts high-profile submissions in the fundamental, translational and clinical areas of tumor immunology. Submissions dealing with solid or hematological cancers, inflammation, innate and acquired immune responses are welcome. OncoImmunology publishes Original Research Articles, Brief Reports, Reviews, Commentaries and Meeting Reports in these area of research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100255413&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100255413\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

ERSS covers a range of topics revolving around the intersection of energy technologies, fuels, and resources on one side; and social processes and influences - including communities of energy users, people affected by energy production, social institutions, customs, traditions, behaviors, and policies - on the other. Put another way, ERSS investigates the social system surrounding energy technology and hardware. ERSS is of relevance for energy practitioners, researchers interested in the social aspects of energy production or use, and policymakers. Energy Research & Social Science (ERSS) provides an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of how social and technical issues related to both energy production and consumption interact. Energy production, distribution, and consumption all have both technical and human components, and the latter involve the human causes and consequences of energy-related activities and processes as well as social structures that shape how people interact with energy systems. Energy analysis therefore needs to look beyond the dimensions of technology and economics to include these social and human elements.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nuclear Energy and Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100325067&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100325067\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

AJS strives to speak to the general sociology reader and is open to contributions from across the social sciences—sociology, political science, economics, history, anthropology, and statistics—that seriously engage the sociological literature to forge new ways of understanding the social. AJS offers a substantial book review section that identifies the most salient work of both emerging and enduring scholars of social science. Commissioned review essays appear occasionally, offering readers a comparative, in-depth examination of prominent titles. Although AJS publishes a very small percentage of the papers submitted to it, a double-blind review process is available to all qualified submissions, making the journal a center for exchange and debate \"behind\" the printed page and contributing to the robustness of social science research in general.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16926&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16926\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, materials lists with supplier information, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, recipes for reagents and solutions, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols in Microbiology to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments. Current Protocols in Microbiology is the comprehensive resource for all types of experiments pertaining to basic microbiology, and represents the first resource to not only further research in the realm of the individual microorganism but also to promote comparative investigation between them.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12100156717&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12100156717\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We therefore anticipate that only a small proportion of submissions to QST will be selected for publication. We feel that the rapidly growing QST community is looking for a journal with this profile, and one that together we can achieve. Submissions that do not meet QST's strict acceptance criteria may be transferred at the discretion of the journal's editors (with author approval) to other relevant journals in the IOP portfolio for consideration.

Its goal is to promote the rigorous discussion of public policy and contribute to informing policymaking and its public debate. To that end, the journal publishes articles studying the behaviour of individuals and firms, their responses to public policy and the wider effects of government action on the economy, with emphasis on the application of microeconomic insights and empirical methods. Articles are presented in a clear and accessible format designed to appeal to a broad international readership of academics, policymakers and practitioners. We encourage submissions from individuals not associated with the Institute, particularly from academic economists working on applied problems whose results have topical policy application. Fiscal Studies has always promoted the dissemination of quality research in a form understandable to a wide audience, and we intend to strengthen this tradition. To maintain the topicality of the journal, submissions will be refereed quickly.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27094&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

Many are inspired by Marxist, socialist, anarchist, anti-racist, anticolonal, feminist, queer, trans*, green, and postcolonial thought; however, the journal has always welcomed the infusion of new ideas and the shaking-up of old positions through dialogue and discussion, never being committed to just one view of critique. Antipode is committed to the new, the innovative, the creative, and the heretofore unthought radical edges of spatial theorisation and analysis. Its papers are groundbreaking, their clear arguments develop geographical thinking, and they do much more than simply add examples to support what we already know. Antipode papers reflect upon and extend the debates of our time, pushing literatures, knowledge and politics to and beyond their extant boundaries, exploring new themes and agendas, and putting new research or critical analysis to work to make interventions in the order of things.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27470&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=27470\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is particularly committed to publishing high quality work in non-English languages. Its publication focus is further defined by linking the findings of research to teaching and learning in a variety of settings and on all educational levels. Article contributions are expected to meet the highest standards of scholarly excellence, advance theoretical knowledge, and explore clearly stated and well supported implications for teaching. In each of the four regular issues that comprise a volume, The Modern Language Journal publishes 8-10 research studies. At times, a regular issue may also be guest edited, in which case it focuses on a particular topic. A supplementary issue of the journal, usually published in January, offers a variety of formats, from guest edited issues to monograph-length publications. Guidelines for proposing guest edited issues and monographs are posted here on the journal’s Web page. The MLJ also offers Perspectives, a column that appears in the summer issue and presents timely professional concerns for discussion from various perspectives. From time to time, the MLJ also publishes invited critical review essays that consider topically related publications written in any language (e.g., monographs, edited volumes, empirical research articles, essays, reports, policy documents) by placing them into a broad context of scholarly inquiry. The journal is indexed in “Linguistics” and “Education and Educational Research.”","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=100147338&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=100147338\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The aim of the Journal of Clinical Periodontology is to provide the platform for exchange of scientific and clinical progress in the field of Periodontology and allied disciplines, and to do so at the highest possible level. The Journal also aims to facilitate the application of new scientific knowledge to the daily practice of the concerned disciplines and addresses both practicing clinicians and academics. The Journal is the official publication of the European Federation of Periodontology but wishes to retain its international scope. The Journal publishes original contributions of high scientific merit in the fields of periodontology and implant dentistry. Its scope encompasses the physiology and pathology of the periodontium, the tissue integration of dental implants, the biology and the modulation of periodontal and alveolar bone healing and regeneration, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and therapy of periodontal disease, the clinical aspects of tooth replacement with dental implants, and the comprehensive rehabilitation of the periodontal patient.

The goal of the journal is to provide scholarship that enables decision-makers to thoughtfully and intentionally engage in the decisions that shape this dynamic. The common thread across these fields is the role of technology in society across economic, political and cultural dynamics. Scholarly work in Technology in Society focuses on the social forces that shape technological decisions and the choices that are open to society with respect to technology uses. This includes scholarly and theoretical approaches (history and philosophy of science and technology, technology forecasting, economic growth, and policy, ethics), applied approaches (business innovation, technology management, legal and engineering) and approaches that are from a development perspective (technology transfer, technology assessment and economic development).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Business and International

It publishes articles that advance the development of market and marketing theory. The AMS Review is receptive to different philosophical perspectives and levels of analysis that range from micro to macro. Especially welcome are manuscripts that integrate research and theory from non-marketing disciplines such as management, sociology, economics, psychology, geography, anthropology, or other social sciences. Examples of suitable manuscripts include those incorporating conceptual and organizing frameworks or models, those extending, comparing, or critically evaluating existing theories, and those suggesting new or innovative theories. Comprehensive and integrative syntheses of research literatures (including quantitative and qualitative meta-analyses) are encouraged, as are paradigm-shifting manuscripts. Manuscripts that focus on purely descriptive literature reviews, proselytize research methods or techniques, or report empirical research findings will not be considered for publication. The AMS Review does not publish manuscripts focusing on practitioner advice or marketing education.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101041413&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101041413\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
