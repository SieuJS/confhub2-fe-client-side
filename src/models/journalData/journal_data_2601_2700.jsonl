We define 'harm reduction' as 'policies and programs which aim to reduce the health, social, and economic costs of legal and illegal psychoactive drug use without necessarily reducing drug consumption'. We are especially interested in studies of the evolving patterns of drug use around the world, their implications for the spread of HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne pathogens, and in accurate descriptions and rigorous evaluations of innovative policies and practices for harm reduction in diverse societies. Harm Reduction Journal also seeks to improve the access to authoritative and current harm reduction literature for health professionals and policy specialists in the non-English speaking world, by offering access to translations of published articles, and their data sets.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine

Examples of DEDSs include manufacturing plants, communication networks, computer systems, management information databases, logistics systems, command-control-communication systems, robotics, and other man-made operational systems. The state processes of such systems cannot be described by differential equations in general. The aim of this journal, Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: Theory and Applications, is to publish high-quality, peer-reviewed papers on the modeling and control of, and all other aspects related to, DEDSs. In particular, the journal publishes papers dealing with general theories and methodologies of DEDSs and their applications to any particular subject, including hybrid systems, as well as papers discussing practical problems from which some generally applicable DEDS theories or methodologies can be formulated; The scope of this journal is defined by its emphasis on discrete events and the dynamic nature of the systems and on their modeling, control and optimization.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control

IT is open to theory of absolutely all varieties and from all disciplines, provided it addresses problems of politics, broadly defined and pertains to the international. IT welcomes scholarship that uses evidence from the real world to advance theoretical arguments. However, IT is intended as a forum where scholars can develop theoretical arguments in depth without an expectation of extensive empirical analysis. ITâ€™s over-arching goal is to promote communication and engagement across theoretical and disciplinary traditions. IT puts a premium on contributorsâ€™ ability to reach as broad an audience as possible, both in the questions they engage and in their accessibility to other approaches. This might be done by addressing problems that can only be understood by combining multiple disciplinary discourses, like institutional design, or practical ethics; or by addressing phenomena that have broad ramifications, like civilizing processes in world politics, or the evolution of environmental norms. IT is also open to work that remains within one scholarly tradition, although in that case authors must make clear the horizon of their arguments in relation to other theoretical approaches.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900191537&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900191537\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

While many people use the Internet for educational and entertainment purposes, organizations and companies are looking for ways to tie their internal networks to this global network to conduct electronic commerce. While companies have been conducting business electronically with suppliers and customers for many years, conducting online commerce via the Internet offers even greater opportunities for multinational, national, and even small businesses to cut costs, improve efficiency, and reach a global market. According to some, the Internet will \"drive the economy into the next century.\" Numerous companies already conduct business on the Internet while others scramble to create a presence and catch up. The ability to conduct business anywhere at anytime with anybody who has access to the Internet is definitely moving society a little closer to the \"global village\" concept that has been touted as a future way of life. More importantly, it is changing the face of business and commerce. Because of the significance of the impact of the Internet on business and organizations, the Journal of Internet CommerceÂ® is devoted to publishing articles that discuss issues vital to conducting electronic commerce on the Internet. Additionally, the journal will also solicit and publish manuscripts dealing with educational issues related to Internet commerce.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4700152784&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=4700152784\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Managerial psychology is a field that applies psychological principles and theory to executive and managerial roles, to support, improve, and advance the effectiveness of those in the roles towards achieving a healthy, meaningful, and productive organization. JMP strongly encourages empirical articles based on theory and a solid literature foundation that are interesting, novel, impactful, and well executed. The journal has no methodological preference; papers that fall along the qualitative to quantitative to mixed-method approach are welcome and will be given full consideration. Book reviews are not appropriate for the journal. Consideration will be given for full literature reviews that support and justify a series of propositions and advancement of theory in managerial psychology. Thus, conceptual papers grounded in a solid literature foundation, which provides for theoretical development and advancement in the field, are welcome. Case studies that describe actual interventions or experiences within organizations that are grounded in rigorous scientific methods, such as quasi-experimentation, and that can advance the field are welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied

The journal's prime objective is to provide an international review of the state-of-the-art in economic modelling. Economic Modelling has so far published the complete versions of many large-scale macroeconomic models (for advanced and less developed countries and both closed and open economies) which have been developed for policy analysis. Examples are the Bank of England Model and the US Federal Reserve Board Model. As individual models are revised and updated, the journal continues to publish subsequent papers dealing with these revisions, including structural macro-modeling in a VAR framework or in the latest DSGE settings. The journal publishes policy-relevant theoretical and applied papers in macroeconomics and other fields of economics, such as development economics, energy economics, environmental economics, financial economics, health economics, industrial economics, international economics, microeconomics, public economics, and urban economics. The journal also welcomes cutting-edge empirical papers in heterodox economics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28467&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=28467\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Simulation studies, either to demonstrate properties of an existing method or to compare several existing methods (without providing a new method), also have low priority.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16444&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16444\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Journal focuses on two key concepts: human development and application of knowledge. Human development refers to the transformations and changes that occur during the life cycle and the processes or mechanisms which influence individuals' behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and moral development. Application refers to how the knowledge gained from research can be applied to the improvement of developmental outcomes, such as through policy making or within educational, clinical, and social settings. Consequently, papers published in JADP explicitly articulate how findings can be applied to improving the lives of children, youth and young adults. JADP publishes studies on a broad array of social issues and contexts (e.g., differences in cultural, racial, social and learning contexts) that impact human development.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15385&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15385\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
