We view integrated, interdisciplinary research as being essential for the advancement of the subject area; therefore, we do not seek manuscripts focused purely on sedimentology, structural geology, or geophysics that have a natural home in specialist journals. Rather, we seek manuscripts that treat sedimentary basins as multi-component systems that require a multi-faceted approach to advance our understanding of their development. During deposition and subsidence we are concerned with large-scale geodynamic processes, heat flow, fluid flow, strain distribution, seismic and sequence stratigraphy, modelling, burial and inversion histories. In addition, we view the development of the source area, in terms of drainage networks, climate, erosion, denudation and sediment routing systems as vital to sedimentary basin systems. The underpinning requirement is that a contribution should be of interest to earth scientists of more than one discipline.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=22017&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=22017\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The aims parallel that of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology by increasing the fundamental understanding of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders affected by the immune system or vice versa and towards pharmacologic measures that lead, either to a better understanding of disease mechanisms, or by improving disease outcomes. The scope of JNIP includes all primary works and reviews into the etiology, prevention, and treatment of neuroimmune and nervous system diseases affected by disordered immunity. Original studies serving to define neuroimmune modulation of environmental or endogenous cues such as toxins and drugs of abuse, hormones, and cytokines are welcome. JNIP will serve as a reliable source of interdisciplinary information bridging the fields of pharmacology, immunology, and neuroscience.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4700152872&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

It publishes article types including Research Papers, Reviews, Editorials, Communications, etc. Our aim is to encourage scientists to publish their experimental and theoretical results in as much detail as possible. The full experimental details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. There is, in addition, a unique feature of this journal: we accept studies showing meaningful but negative results. While there are many journals that focus on cancer studies, none of them actively accepts negative results. As a result, most negative data end up not being in the public domain even if the data were meaningfully negative and the study well designed. By accepting those negative results, our journal encourages scientists to share those data so that they would not need to repeat the experiments that somebody else has already done. We publish high-quality articles including basic, translational, and clinical studies on all tumor types.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700188419&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700188419\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

IMR does this by publishing novel research ideas, and by publishing papers that add substance to, question the basic assumptions of, reframe, or otherwise shape what we think we know within in the international marketing field. IMR is pluralistic, publishing papers that are conceptual, quantitative-empirical, or qualitative-empirical. At IMR, we aim to be a journal that recognizes great papers and great research ideas, and works hard with authors to nurture those ideas through to publication. We aim to be a journal that is proactive in developing the research agenda in international marketing, by identifying critical research issues, and promoting research within those areas. Finally, IMR is a journal that is comfortable exploring, and that fosters the exploration of, the interfaces and overlaps between international marketing and other business disciplines. Where no interfaces or overlaps exist, IMR will be a journal that is ready to create them. IMR’s definition of international marketing is purposefully broad and includes, although is not restricted to: -International market entry decisions and relationships; -Export marketing and supply chain issues; -International retailing; -International channel management; -Consumer ethnocentrism, country and product image and origin effects; -Cultural considerations in international marketing;

Papers published in Human Factors leverage fundamental knowledge of human capabilities and limitations – and the basic understanding of cognitive, physical, behavioral, physiological, social, developmental, affective, and motivational aspects of human performance – to yield design principles; enhance training, selection, and communication; and ultimately improve human-system interfaces and sociotechnical systems that lead to safer and more effective outcomes. Human Factors will be of particular interest to those interested in areas such as human factors/ergonomics, human-systems integration, automation, robotics, human-computer interaction, transportation, health-care systems, aviation and aerospace, aging, teamwork, education and training, military systems, architecture, applied psychology, biomechanics, cognitive psychology, cognitive science,

The journal´s main focus is original research work on intrinsic, innate or adaptive immune responses to viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic (protozoan and helminthic) infections and on the virulence of the respective infectious pathogens. MMIM covers basic, translational as well as clinical research in infectious diseases and infectious disease immunology. Basic research using cell cultures, organoid, and animal models are welcome, provided that the models have a clinical correlate and address a relevant medical question. The journal also considers manuscripts on the epidemiology of infectious diseases, including the emergence and epidemic spreading of pathogens and the development of resistance to anti-infective therapies, and on novel vaccines and other innovative measurements of prevention. The following categories of manuscripts will not be considered for publication in MMIM: submissions of preliminary work, of merely descriptive data sets without investigation of mechanisms or of limited global interest, manuscripts on existing or novel anti-infective compounds, which focus on pharmaceutical or pharmacological aspects of the drugs, manuscripts on existing or modified vaccines, unless they report on experimental or clinical efficacy studies or provide new immunological information on their mode of action, manuscripts on the diagnostics of infectious diseases, unless they offer a novel concept to solve a pending diagnostic problem, case reports or case series, unless they are embedded in a study that focuses on the anti-infectious immune response and/or on the virulence of a pathogen.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology

The Editors welcome intellectually diverse contributions that advance planning theory understanding and debate. There exists a broad range of views about what planning theory is and could, or should, be. This reflects an equally diverse range of views about the processes and products of planning as practised in different parts of the world. One of the roles of Planning Theory as a journal is to work through the agreements and tensions between views by publishing quality papers presenting, for instance, strong theoretical arguments, innovative ways of thinking, new ways of applying theory and so on.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4400151522&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=4400151522\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The underlying theme is that uncertainties associated with geomaterials (soils, rocks), geologic processes, and possible subsequent treatments, are usually large and complex and these uncertainties play an indispensable role in the risk assessment and management of engineered and natural systems. Significant theoretical and practical challenges remain on quantifying these uncertainties and developing defensible risk management methodologies that are acceptable to decision makers and stakeholders. Many opportunities to leverage on the rapid advancement in Bayesian analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other data-driven methods also exist, which can greatly enhance our decision-making abilities. The basic goal of this international peer-reviewed journal is to provide a multi-disciplinary scientific forum for cross fertilization of ideas between interested parties working on various aspects of georisk to advance the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Building and

The Journal of Aging & Social Policy examines the important policy issues that affect the elderly in societies throughout the world. The Journal of Aging & Social Policy presents insightful contributions from an international and interdisciplinary panel of policy analysts and scholars. The journal examines and analyzes critical phenomena that affect aging and development and implementation of programs for elders from a global perspective, highlighting not only the United States but also Europe, the Middle East, Australia, Latin America, Asia, and the Asia-Pacific rim. Issues regularly addressed in the journal include: long-term services and supports; home- and community-based care; nursing-home care; assisted living; long-term care financing; financial security; employment and training; public and private pension coverage; housing; transportation; health care access, financing, and quality; family dynamics; and retirement. In addition to major issues associated with growing older, the Journal of Aging & Social Policy closely examines the processes for adopting policies and programs at the local, state, and federal levels, examining the interplay of political and economic forces and legal and regulatory constraints on addressing the major challenges posed by the “greying” of society. The Journal of Aging & Social Policy is an essential source for critical and historical analysis, cutting-edge thought and discussion on age-based policy, and is a must for educators, practitioners, researchers, administrators, and other readers who work with or are concerned about older adults.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Demography","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Life-span

That continues to be our mission, with a clear focus on topics concerned with research and practice in transportation policy and planning, around the world. These four words, policy and planning, research and practice are our key words. While we have a particular focus on transportation policy analysis and travel behaviour in the context of ground transportation, we willingly consider all good quality papers that are highly relevant to transportation policy, planning and practice with a clear focus on innovation, on extending the international pool of knowledge and understanding. Our interest is not only with transportation policies - and systems and services – but also with their social, economic and environmental impacts, However, papers about the application of established procedures to, or the development of plans or policies for, specific locations are unlikely to prove acceptable unless they report experience which will be of real benefit those working elsewhere. Papers concerned with the engineering, safety and operational management of transportation systems are outside our scope.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Civil and Structural

ESEU will discuss the entanglement between environmental sciences and regulation because, in recent years, there have been misunderstandings and even disagreement between stakeholders in these two areas. ESEU will help to improve the comprehension of issues between environmental sciences and regulation. ESEU will be an outlet from the German-speaking (DACH) countries to Europe and an inlet from Europe to the DACH countries regarding environmental sciences and regulation. Moreover, ESEU will facilitate the exchange of ideas and interaction between Europe and the DACH countries regarding environmental regulatory issues. Although Europe is at the center of ESEU, the journal will not exclude the rest of the world, because regulatory issues pertaining to environmental sciences can be fully seen only from a global perspective.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900191887&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900191887\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The primary aim of DMM is to promote human health by inspiring collaboration between basic and clinical researchers in translational science. The journal is committed to presenting highly significant research that meets this goal. The interdisciplinary nature of DMM means that a diverse range of diseases, approaches and models fall within its scope. Examples of DMM content: -Basic research that significantly advances our understanding of human disease mechanisms, diagnosis or treatment, and is of broad relevance -Drug screens and preclinical analyses of candidate therapies using model systems -Presentation of new models that have been thoroughly validated to demonstrate their utility in disease studies* -New methods and resources that provide broadly useful tools for a disease and/or model community -Comprehensive, expert reviews and posters addressing current and emerging themes in biomedical science -Interviews with leading scientists in translational research -Editorials that discuss wider issues of interest to the community, including regulatory, ethical and policy issues -Special collections that collate articles relating to a particular disease area or model system *Descriptive work, such as the characterisation of a model system without demonstration of its usefulness to advance a field, is generally not considered for publication, unless the new model itself is considered by the Editorial team to provide an improved understanding of the disease mechanism and/or to demonstrate clear usefulness for the evaluation of treatment approaches.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics
