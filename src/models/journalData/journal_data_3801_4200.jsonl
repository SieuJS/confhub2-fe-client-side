JCSHM serves as a focal point for sharing knowledge and experience in technologies impacting the discipline of Civil Structural Health Monitoring, especially in terms of condition assessments, forensic analysis, load capacity ratings and service life estimations. Original articles to further the state-of-the-art in diagnostics and prognostics for civil infrastructure systems including highways, bridges, buildings, airports, seaports, railroads, water resources systems, oil and gas pipelines, and similar topics are welcomed. There is an important role for papers that address the application of principles, either successfully or from a lesson learned aspect. This is of course the key facet of engineering as opposed to basic science – engineers take ideas and develop them into applications and use in the field. Purely theoretical and or numerical submissions without field applications or laboratory verifications and assessments are not accepted for publication in JCSHM.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100238624&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100238624\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

As such, it addresses all works whereby security is achieved through a combination of techniques from cryptography, computer security, machine learning and multimedia signal processing. Application domains lie, for example, in secure storage, retrieval and tracking of multimedia data, secure outsourcing of computations, forgery detection of multimedia data, or secure use of biometrics. The journal also welcomes survey papers that give the reader a gentle introduction to one of the topics covered as well as papers that report large-scale experimental evaluations of existing techniques. Pure cryptographic papers are outside the scope of the journal.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Signal Processing","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100812851&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100812851\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The topics covered are results of research concerned with the quantitative features and characteristics of science. Emphasis is placed on investigations in which the development and mechanism of science are studied by means of (statistical) mathematical methods. The Journal also provides the reader with important up-to-date information about international meetings and events in scientometrics and related fields. Appropriate bibliographic compilations are published as a separate section. Due to its fully interdisciplinary character, Scientometrics is indispensable to research workers and research administrators throughout the world. It provides valuable assistance to librarians and documentalists in central scientific agencies, ministries, research institutes and laboratories. Scientometrics includes the Journal of Research Communication Studies. Consequently its aims and scope cover that of the latter, namely, to bring the results of research investigations together in one place, in such a form that they will be of use not only to the investigators themselves but also to the entrepreneurs and research workers who form the object of these studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science

Work on self and identity has a special place in the study of human nature, as self-concerns are arguably at the center of individuals’ striving for well-being and for making sense of one’s life. Life goals develop and are influenced by one’s view of what one is like, the way one would ideally like to be (or would like to avoid being), as well as one’s perceptions of what is feasible. Furthermore, conceptions of self and the world affect how one’s progress towards these goals is monitored, evaluated, redirected, re-evaluated, and pursued again. Thus, the \"self\" as a construct has far-reaching implications for behavior, self-esteem, motivation, experience of emotions and the world more broadly, and hence for interpersonal relationships, society, and culture. The Journal aims to bring together empirical work on self and identity undertaken by researchers across different subdisciplines within psychology (e.g., social, personality, clinical, development, cognitive), as well as across other social and behavioral disciplines (e.g., sociology, family studies, anthropology, neuroscience). Special emphasis is placed on new empirical research that is relevant for extant theoretical models and generative in opening new terrain for future investigation. A second continual motivating goal of the Journal is empirical research that offers integration at the level of basic processes. The Journal provides scientists, practitioners, and students in psychology, sociology, consumer behavior, behavioral medicine, and psychiatry around the world with access to cutting edge empirical research and occasional theoretical pieces.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5800179627&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5800179627\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The current advances in computing, networking technology and software have spurred a lot of research interest in cluster and internet computing, as demonstrated in Cloud and Grid computing, and distributed high performance data centers. In the last few years, we have seen an increased interest in developing applications, software tools, communications protocols and high performance data centers, Grids and cloud computing sites to capitalize on these advances and initiatives. Publications about these developments currently appear in several journals that either focus on the communications field, or on parallel and distributed computing with a strong emphasis on the parallel algorithms.

The journal's central consideration is how to challenge and facilitate creative potential, and how then to embed this into results-oriented innovative business development. The creativity of individuals, coupled with structured and well-managed innovation projects, creates a sound base from which organizations may operate effectively within their inter-organizational and societal environment. Today, successful operations must go hand in hand with the ability to anticipate future opportunities. Therefore, a cultural focus and inspiring leadership are as crucial to an organization's success as efficient structural arrangements and support facilities. This is reflected in the journal's contents: -Leadership for creativity and innovation; the behavioural side of innovation management. -Organizational structures and processes to support creativity and innovation; interconnecting creative and innovative processes. -Creativity, motivation, work environment/creative climate and organizational behaviour, creative and innovative entrepreneurship. -Deliberate development of creative and innovative skills including the use of a variety of tools such as TRIZ or CPS. -Creative professions and personalities; creative products; the relationship between creativity and humour; arts and amp; humanities side of creativity.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100218364&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100218364\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Submissions should focus on key problems in motivation and emotion, and, if using non-human participants, should contribute to theories concerning human behavior. Articles should be explanatory rather than merely descriptive, providing the data necessary to understand the origins of motivation and emotion, to explicate why, how, and under what conditions motivational and emotional states change, and to document that these processes are important to human functioning. A range of methodological approaches are welcome, with methodological rigor as the key criterion. Manuscripts that rely exclusively on self-report data are appropriate, but published articles tend to be those that rely on objective measures (e.g., behavioral observations, psychophysiological responses, reaction times, brain activity, and performance or achievement indicators) either singly or combination with self-report data. The journal generally does not publish scale development and validation articles. However, it is open to articles that focus on the post-validation contribution that a new measure can make. Scale development and validation work therefore may be submitted if it is used as a necessary prerequisite to follow-up studies that demonstrate the importance of the new scale in making a theoretical advance.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12710&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12710\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Sustainable development is therefore only possible, if our society attempts to find and implement environmentally compatible, socially acceptable and economically viable means to acquire its energy services. This challenge requires systemic and holistic innovations that include a sustainable supply of resources, the development of highly efficient technical solutions and the adaptation of energy systems to the environmental, economic and cultural context as well as the social and political framework to enable sustainable energy systems to be implemented for the welfare of mankind. The aim of the journal is to provide an international and interdisciplinary forum for the discourse between natural scientists, engineers, social & political scientists as well as experts from industry who drive the innovation of sustainable energy systems. It is the particular aim of this journal to publish papers extending across different disciplines and providing a substantial contribution to the holistic innovation of these energy systems. In line with the goal of this journal to offer an interdisciplinary forum of discourse for systemic energy innovation, the scope of the journal encompasses the whole innovation process ranging from scientific research to both innovative approaches for technology implementation and the analysis of economic, social and environmental impacts of sustainable energy systems. Main emphasis will be placed on papers addressing complex issues with innovation potential at the interface between technical solutions, their implementation and their social, environmental and economic impacts.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100286318&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100286318\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Articles published in JREE should advance our knowledge of factors important for educational success and/or improve our ability to conduct further disciplined studies of pressing educational problems. JREE welcomes manuscripts that fit into one of the following categories: (1) intervention, evaluation, and policy studies; (2) theory, contexts, and mechanisms; and (3) methodological studies. The first category includes studies that focus on process and implementation and seek to demonstrate causal claims in educational research. The second category includes meta-analyses and syntheses, descriptive studies that illuminate educational conditions and contexts, and studies that rigorously investigate education processes and mechanism. The third category includes studies that advance our understanding of theoretical and technical features of measurement and research design and describe advances in data analysis and data modeling. To establish a stronger connection between scientific evidence and educational practice, studies submitted to JREE should focus on pressing problems found in classrooms and schools. Studies that help advance our understanding and demonstrate effectiveness related to challenges in reading, mathematics education, and science education are especially welcome as are studies related to cognitive functions, social processes, organizational factors, and cultural features that mediate and/or moderate critical educational outcomes. On occasion, invited responses to JREE articles and rejoinders to those responses will be included in an issue.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700187625&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700187625\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal concentrates both on the forms, contents and contexts of physical education, sport and health education found in schools, colleges and other sites of formal education, as well as the pedagogies of play, calisthenics, gymnastics, sport and leisure found in familial contexts, sports clubs, the leisure industry, private fitness and health studios, dance schools and rehabilitation centres. In addition to papers reporting original research, Sport, Education and Society will also consider various media (e.g., TV, film, web sites) as forms of pedagogy and report their impact on understandings of the body in society. Sport, Education and Society encourages contributions not only from social scientists and educationalists studying the relationships between pedagogy, ‘the body’ and society, but from all professionals with interests in theoretical and empirical interests relating to policy, curriculum, social inclusion, equity and identity, and progressive educational development in physical activity, health and sport.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics

It explores the environmental dimensions of common policies such as spatial planning (urban, rural and marine), natural resource management, agriculture and food, fisheries, water, energy and transport, all stages in the policy and planning processes from formulation to implementation, and the interactions between governments and markets, the strategies of non-governmental organizations and business in relation to the environment, natural resources and land-use. The Journal invites original papers applying approaches from the political and social sciences, political economy, human geography, planning and cultural studies. Papers addressing any of the following areas are of particular interest: -Theoretically guided studies that enhance the understanding of the environmental policy process; -Analyses of environmental governance at different spatial levels; -Research into political and planning responses to particular environmental problems, on a global, regional or local scale; -Contributions on policy instruments, environmental management and environmental and sustainability assessment techniques; -Comparative studies and evaluations of cross-national learning and policy development. The Journal publishes papers that critically engage with theories and analytical approaches which can be applied in environmental policy or planning studies and thus contribute to broader debates. Descriptive narratives, case studies and analyses not engaging with such theories and debates are usually not considered for publication. The Journal is keen to promote inter-disciplinary social science perspectives on both the theory and methodology for analyzing contemporary environmental issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23374&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23374\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal encourages research that connects theory and practice, enhances our understanding of L2 phonological learning processes, and provides connections between L2 pronunciation and other areas of applied linguistics such as pragmatics, CALL, and speech perception. The Journal publishes papers in four main areas: experimental, instructed, and naturalistic research about second language pronunciation; review articles that synthesize research perspectives of key pronunciation issues from different disciplines; teaching-oriented papers detailing successful practices and research-based instruction; and invited reviews of technology and books focused on second language pronunciation. Contributions focusing on empirical research will represent all portions of the methodological spectrum including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies. The journal invites papers on topics such as intelligibility and comprehensibility, accent, phonological acquisition, the use of technology (such as automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and CAPT), spoken language assessment, the social impact of L2 pronunciation, the ethics of pronunciation teaching, pronunciation acquisition in less commonly taught languages, speech perception and its relationship to speech production, and other topics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101060650&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101060650\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

However, the intellectual challenge which teaching presents has been inadequately acknowledged and theorised in higher education. Teaching in Higher Education addresses this gap by publishing scholarly work that critically examines and interrogates the values and presuppositions underpinning teaching, introduces theoretical perspectives and insights drawn from different disciplinary and methodological frameworks, and considers how teaching and research can be brought into a closer relationship. The journal welcomes contributions that aim to develop sustained reflection, investigation and critique, and that critically identify new agendas for research, for example by: examining the impact on teaching exerted by wider contextual factors such as policy, funding, institutional change and the expectations of society; developing conceptual analyses of pedagogical issues and debates, such as authority, power, assessment and the nature of understanding; exploring the various values which underlie teaching including those concerned with social justice and equity; offering critical accounts of lived experiences of higher education pedagogies which bring together theory and practice. Authors are strongly encouraged to engage with and build on previous contributions and issues raised in the journal. Please note that the journal does not publish: -descriptions and/or evaluations of policy and/or practice; -localised case studies that are not contextualized and theorised; -large-scale surveys that are not theoretically and critically analysed; -studies that simply replicate previous work without establishing originality.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=200147112&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=200147112\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is meant for ecologists who, because of their research interests or occupation, are involved in designing, monitoring, or restoring ecosystems, and can serve as a bridge between ecologists and engineers. Specific topics covered in the journal include: habitat reconstruction; ecotechnology; synthetic ecology; bioengineering; restoration ecology; ecology conservation; ecosystem rehabilitation; stream and river restoration; reclamation ecology; non-renewable resource conservation. Descriptions of specific applications of ecological engineering are acceptable only when situated within context of adding novelty to current research and emphasizing ecosystem restoration. We do not accept purely descriptive reports on ecosystem structures (such as vegetation surveys), purely physical assessment of materials that can be used for ecological restoration, small-model studies carried out in the laboratory or greenhouse with artificial (waste)water or crop studies, or case studies on conventional wastewater treatment and eutrophication that do not offer an ecosystem restoration approach within the paper.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental

The speech and language sciences have a long history, but it is only relatively recently that large-scale implementation of and experimentation with complex models of speech and language processing has become feasible. Such research is often carried out somewhat separately by practitioners of artificial intelligence, computer science, electronic engineering, information retrieval, linguistics, phonetics, or psychology. The journal provides a focus for this work, and encourages an interdisciplinary approach to speech and language research and technology. Thus contributions from all of the related fields are welcomed in the form of reports of theoretical or experimental studies, tutorials, reviews, and brief correspondence pertaining to models and their implementation, or reports of fundamental research leading to the improvement of such models.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Human-Computer

Typical articles explore lipidology as it is practiced in the treatment setting, recent developments in pharmacological research, reports of treatment and trials, case studies, the impact of lifestyle modification, and similar academic material of interest to the practitioner. While preference is given to material of immediate practical concern, the science that underpins lipidology is forwarded by expert contributors so that evidence-based approaches to reducing cardiovascular and coronary heart disease can be made immediately available to our readers. Sections of the Journal will address pioneering studies and the clinicians who conduct them, case studies, ethical standards and conduct, professional guidance such as ATP and NCEP, editorial commentary, letters from readers, National Lipid Association (NLA) news and upcoming event information, as well as abstracts from the NLA annual scientific sessions and the scientific forums held by its chapters, when appropriate.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular

The scope of the journal deliberately is very broad in terms of both substance and methods. `Learning environment' refers to the social, physical, psychological and pedagogical contexts in which learning occurs and which affect student achievement and attitudes. The aim of the journal is to increase our understanding of pre-primary, primary, high school, college and university, and lifelong learning environments irrespective of subject area. Apart from classroom-level and school-level environments, special attention is given to the many out-of-school learning environments such as the home, science centres, and television, etc. The influence of the rapidly developing field of Information Technology with its whole new range of learning environments is an important aspect of the scope of the journal.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental

The journal publishes reviews and editorials, experimental and preclinical studies, translational research, prospectively designed clinical trials, and epidemiological studies. Papers containing new clinical or experimental data that are likely to contribute to changes in clinical practice or the way in which a disease is thought about will be given priority due to their immediate importance. Case reports will be accepted on an exceptional basis only, and their submission is discouraged. The major criteria for publication are clarity, scientific soundness, and advances in knowledge. In compliance with the overwhelmingly prevailing request by the international scientific community, and with respect for eco-compatibility issues, CEM is now published exclusively online.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29302&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29302\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It is concerned with macro-level coverage of topics in the sociology and social psychology of language, and in language and cultural politics, policy, planning and practice.Authors are encouraged tp reject a defocot view of multilingualism and hence avoid terms such as 'native speaker, non-native speaker' and use neutral terms such as 'L1 user, LX user' instead. The journal welcomes submissions on the many ramifications of these broad themes: -Language planning and policy- Ethnicity and nationalism- Identity politics (with its linguistic, religious and other markers)- Languages and cultures in contact- Intertwinings among language, culture and religion- Language learning- Bilingual and multilingual accommodations- Translation- Programmes and policies of multiculturalism and pluralism- Language rights (group and individual)- “Popular” and folk sociolinguistics and usage- Reading and literacy- Contemporary religious and cultural debates- Collective identity and its “markers”- Minority-group dynamics- Educational provisions for languages and cultures- Endangered languages. Contributions that allow generalisation across settings are particularly welcome, as are those that embed the discussion in social and historical context.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cultural

Submissions to Marine Policy must contribute to the formulation and understanding of marine policy, and must be of interest to a broad audience of academics, stakeholders and officials. Marine Policy offers researchers, analysts, stakeholders and policy-makers a unique combination of analyses in the principal social science disciplines relevant to the formulation of marine policy. Articles represent perspectives from fields such as marine affairs, marine economics and resource management, political science, marine science, human ecology, international law, geography, normative theory, anthropology and similar disciplines. Focal areas include, but are not limited to: international, regional and national marine policies; institutional arrangements for the management and regulation of marine activities; conflict resolution; marine pollution and environment; conservation and use of marine resources. We are not a technical journal and will recommend that overly-technical papers are transferred to other more relevant journals. We will consider policy papers that do include a technical analysis, but only if this directly informs a policy analysis or discussion. We request that authors minimise the inclusion of formulas and model details needed to explain the methods and analysis in the main text. Detailed formulae and calculations should be included in an appendix or supplementary materials, and summarised in the main text.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aquatic

Contributions range from original scientific articles concerned with fundamental and applied aspects of research or direct applications of metallic, inorganic, organic and composite coatings, to invited reviews of current technology in specific areas. Papers submitted to this journal are expected to be in line with the following aspects in processes, and properties/performance: A. Processes: Physical and chemical vapour deposition techniques, thermal and plasma spraying, surface modification by directed energy techniques such as ion, electron and laser beams, thermo-chemical treatment, wet chemical and electrochemical processes such as plating, sol-gel coating, anodization, plasma electrolytic oxidation, etc., but excluding painting. B. Properties/performance: friction performance, wear resistance (e.g., abrasion, erosion, fretting, etc), corrosion and oxidation resistance, thermal protection, diffusion resistance, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, and properties relevant to smart materials behaviour and enhanced multifunctional performance for environmental, energy and medical applications, but excluding device aspects.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry

It adheres to a blinded peer-review process in which the reviewer's name is routinely withheld from the author unless the reviewer requests a preference for their identity to be revealed. All manuscripts are reviewed initially by the Editors and only those papers that meet the scientific and editorial standards of the journal, and fit within the aims and scope of the journal, will be sent for outside review. Emotion Review focuses on ideas about emotion, with \"emotion\" broadly defined. The Review publishes articles presenting new theories, offering conceptual analyses, reviewing the literature, and debating and critiquing conceptual issues. It publishes reports of empirical studies and method only when they make a substantial theoretical contribution. Emotion Review invites the submission of articles from researchers in any discipline. These disciplines include, but are not limited to, anthropology, biology, computer science, economics, history, humanities, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, physiology, political science, psychiatry, psychology, and sociology. Emotion Review also invites the submission of commentaries on previously published articles. Both original articles and commentaries on previous articles are treated as manuscripts and submitted in the same manner. All submissions are reviewed with respect to their scholarly merit. Emotion Review invites articles from the entire international community. We encourage authors to make their articles as accessible as possible to a wide audience of fellow emotion researchers from other disciplines.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17500155105&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17500155105\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Immunological Medicine , previously known as the Japanese Journal of Clinical Immunology ( Nippon Rinsho Men-eki Gakkai Kaishi), is the official journal of the Japanese Society of Clinical Immunology (JSCI). Moving away from its previous medium of paper publication, the journal is now fully Online-only. Recent progress in the field of clinical immunology has been remarkable. Many diseases and conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergy-related diseases, infectious diseases, malignant diseases, immunodeficiency and transplantation-related conditions are associated with immunological abnormalities and require immunological approaches from various medical fields. Clinical immunology plays an increasingly important role as the bridge between basic research and clinical practice, with the significance of translational research rapidly increasing in recent years. Considering such developments, the Society aims to publish an international and interdisciplinary journal for dissemination to a global audience. Immunological Medicine encourages the submission of original manuscripts covering a wide range of topics such as rheumatology, allergology, oncology, hematology, cardiology, neurology, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology, nephrology, dermatology, pediatrics and other medical topics that relate to both basic and clinical immunology.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100870666&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100870666\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers relating to the structure, properties and behaviour of engineering materials are encouraged, particularly those which also involve the detailed application of materials parameters to problems in engineering structures, components and design. In addition to the area of materials engineering, the interacting fields of mechanical, manufacturing, aeronautical, civil, chemical, corrosion and design engineering are considered relevant. Activity should be directed at analysing engineering failures and carrying out research to help reduce the incidences of failures and to extend the operating horizons of engineering materials. Emphasis is placed on the mechanical properties of materials and their behaviour when influenced by structure, process and environment. Metallic, polymeric, ceramic and natural materials are all included and the application of these materials to real engineering situations should be emphasised. The use of a case-study based approach is also encouraged. Engineering Failure Analysis provides essential reference material and critical feedback into the design process thereby contributing to the prevention of engineering failures in the future. All submissions will be subject to peer review from leading experts in the field.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aerospace Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Aerospace

By its nature, multiscale modeling is highly interdisciplinary, with developments occurring independently across fields. A broad range of scientific and engineering problems involve multiple scales. Traditional monoscale approaches have proven to be inadequate, even with the largest supercomputers, because of the range of scales and the prohibitively large number of variables involved. Thus, there is a growing need to develop systematic modeling and simulation approaches for multiscale problems. MMS will provide a single broad, authoritative source for results in this area.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry

Since its foundation in 1964, it has published many seminal articles on development and opened up new areas of debate. Priority is given to papers which are: • relevant to important current research in development policy, theory and analysis • make a novel and significant contribution to the field • provide critical tests, based on empirical work, of alternative theories, perspectives or schools of thought We invite articles that are interdisciplinary or focused on particular disciplines (e.g. economics, politics, geography, sociology or anthropology), with an expectation that all work is accessible to readers across the social sciences. The editors also welcome surveys of the literature in important fields of development policy. All research articles in this journal undergo rigorous peer review, based on initial editor screening and anonymous peer review.
