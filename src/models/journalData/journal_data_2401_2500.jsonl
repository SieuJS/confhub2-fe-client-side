The journal draws upon the experience of the highly successful “IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing” and provide a complementary medium for the wide range of topics in applied earth observations. The ‘Applications’ areas encompasses the societal benefit areas of the Global Earth Observations Systems of Systems (GEOSS) program. Through deliberations over two years, ministers from 50 countries agreed to identify nine areas where Earth observation could positively impact the quality of life and health of their respective countries. Some of these are areas not traditionally addressed in the IEEE context. These include biodiversity, health and climate. Yet it is the skill sets of IEEE members, in areas such as observations, communications, computers, signal processing, standards and ocean engineering, that form the technical underpinnings of GEOSS. Thus, the Journal attracts a broad range of interests that serves both present members in new ways and expands the IEEE visibility into new areas.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17700155033&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17700155033\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Higher Education Research & Development informs and challenges researchers, teachers, administrators, policy-makers and others concerned with the past, present and future of higher education. The journal publishes scholarly articles that make a significant and original contribution to the theory, practice or research of higher education. We welcome theoretical, philosophical and historical articles and essays that address higher education in any of its dimensions. Equally, we welcome empirical higher education studies, which employ qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methodologies including big data. All articles must propose fresh critical insights into the area being addressed and be appropriately framed for an international audience. HERD seeks to foster conversations around particular HE issues and topics over time. To this end, we ask authors to review former issues of HERD and, where possible, engage with previously published articles as part of preparing your manuscript for submission to us.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18300156704&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18300156704\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The focus of NeuroImage: Clinical is on defining changes to the brain associated with primary neurologic and psychiatric diseases and disorders of the nervous system as well as behavioral syndromes and developmental conditions. The main criterion for judging papers is the extent of scientific advancement in the understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of diseases and disorders, in identification of functional models that link clinical signs and symptoms with brain function and in the creation of image based tools applicable to a broad range of clinical needs including diagnosis, monitoring and tracking of illness, predicting therapeutic response and development of new treatments. Papers dealing with structure and function in animal models will also be considered if they reveal mechanisms that can be readily translated to human conditions.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100222534&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100222534\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is dedicated to the publication of high-quality clinical (all phases), observational, real-world, and health outcomes research around the discovery, development, and use of dermatological therapies. Studies relating to diagnosis, pharmacoeconomics, public health and epidemiology, quality of life, and patient care, management, and education are also encouraged. Areas of focus include, but are not limited to all clinical aspects of dermatology, such as skin pharmacology; skin development and aging; prevention, diagnosis, and management of skin disorders and melanomas; research into dermal structures and pathology; and all areas of aesthetic dermatology, including skin maintenance, dermatological surgery, and lasers. The journal is of interest to a broad audience of pharmaceutical and healthcare professionals and publishes original research, reviews, case reports/case series, trial protocols, and short communications. Dermatology and Therapy will consider all scientifically sound research be it positive, confirmatory or negative data. Submissions are welcomed whether they relate to an International and/or a country-specific audience, something that is crucially important when researchers are trying to target more specific patient populations. This inclusive approach allows the journal to assist in the dissemination of quality research, which may be considered of insufficient interest by other journals. The journal appeals to a global audience and receives submissions from all over the world.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100200440&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100200440\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We publish regular articles, reviews, protocols/system descriptions and viewpoint papers on all aspects of public health, with a focus on innovation and technology in public health.Apart from publishing traditional public health research and viewpoint papers as well as reports from traditional surveillance systems, JPH was one of the first (if not the only) peer-reviewed journal which publishes papers with surveillance or pharmacovigilance data from non-traditional, unstructured big data and text sources such as social media and the Internet (infoveillance, digital disease detection), or reports on novel participatory epidemiology projects, where observations are solicited from the public. Among other innovations, JPH is also dedicated to support rapid open data sharing and rapid open access to surveillance and outbreak data. As one of the novel features we plan to publish rapid or even real-time surveillance reports and open data. The methods and description of the surveillance system may be peer-reviewed and published only once in detail, in a \"baseline report\" (in a JMIR Res Protoc or a JMIR Public Health & Surveill paper), and authors then have the possibility to publish data and reports in frequent intervals rapidly and with only minimal additional peer-review (we call this article type \"Rapid Surveillance Reports\").","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101030810&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101030810\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Social Movement Studies has a broad, inter-disciplinary approach designed to accommodate papers engaging with any theoretical school and which study the origins, development, organisation, values, context and impact of historical and contemporary movements active in all parts of the world. We understand our inter-disciplinary approach to include both contributions that engage with particular schools of thought relevant to social movements and popular protest and contributions that extend across disciplinary boundaries. Social Movement Studies aims to publish soundly researched analyses and to re-establish writing as intervention. From this broad and inclusive perspective we are interested in contributions dealing with social movements, popular protests and networks that support protest. This includes contributions dealing with but not restricted to: • movements of all types including gender, race, sexuality, indigenous people’s rights, • disability, ecology, peace, youth, age, religion, animal rights and others, • forms of communication, media and representation engaged with social change, including the Internet and cybercultures, • networks of support and broad ’ways of life’ engaged with alternative social systems, • appraisals of popular reactionary movements or populist movements of the ’right’, • subcultures and countercultures, including such things as the place of dance, pleasure or music in resistance, • identities and the construction of collective identities, • relations between protests and social structures, including situating movements in local, regional, national, international and global socio-economic and cultural contexts, • theoretical reflections on the significance of social movements and protest.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cultural Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5700161511&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5700161511\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Best Practice & Research: Clinical Rheumatology keeps the clinician or trainee informed of the latest developments and current recommended practice in the rapidly advancing fields of musculoskeletal conditions and science. The series provides a continuous update of current clinical practice. It is a topical serial publication that covers the spectrum of musculoskeletal conditions in a 4-year cycle. Each topic-based issue contains around 200 pages of practical, evidence-based review articles, which integrate the results from the latest original research with current clinical practice and thinking to provide a continuous update. Each issue follows a problem-orientated approach that focuses on the key questions to be addressed, clearly defining what is known and not known.

The scope of the journal extends to areas outside of biology to policy forum, socioeconomic analyses, technoeconomic analyses and systems analysis. Papers do not need a global change component for consideration for publication, it is viewed as implicit that most bioenergy will be beneficial in avoiding at least a part of the fossil fuel energy that would otherwise be used. Key areas covered by the journal: Bioenergy feedstock and bio-oil production: energy crops and algae their management,, genomics, genetic improvements, planting, harvesting, storage, transportation, integrated logistics, production modeling, composition and its modification, pests, diseases and weeds of feedstocks. Manuscripts concerning alternative energy based on biological mimicry are also encouraged (e.g. artificial photosynthesis). Biological Residues/Co-products: from agricultural production, forestry and plantations (stover, sugar, bio-plastics, etc.), algae processing industries, and municipal sources (MSW). Bioenergy and the Environment: ecosystem services, carbon mitigation, land use change, life cycle assessment, energy and greenhouse gas balances, water use, water quality, assessment of sustainability, and biodiversity issues. Bioenergy Socioeconomics: examining the economic viability or social acceptability of crops, crops systems and their processing, including genetically modified organisms [GMOs], health impacts of bioenergy systems. Bioenergy Policy: legislative developments affecting biofuels and bioenergy. Bioenergy Systems Analysis: examining biological developments in a whole systems context.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Forestry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100216308&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100216308\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This has led to the emergence of new research domains dealing with the recognition by computers of the constituent elements of documents - including characters, symbols, text, lines, graphics, images, handwriting, signatures, etc. In addition, these new domains deal with automatic analyses of the overall physical and logical structures of documents, with the ultimate objective of a high-level understanding of their semantic content. We have also seen renewed interest in optical character recognition (OCR) and handwriting recognition during the last decade. Document analysis and recognition are obviously the next stage. Automatic, intelligent processing of documents is at the intersections of many fields of research, especially of computer vision, image analysis, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence, as well as studies on reading, handwriting and linguistics. Although quality document related publications continue to appear in journals dedicated to these domains, the community will benefit from having this journal as a focal point for archival literature dedicated to document analysis and recognition.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=130138&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=130138\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Thus, the journal is aimed at the growing trend in robotics toward mobility, intelligence and autonomy in an unstructured world. This trend has been made possible by small, inexpensive, high-performance computers. The term `robot' implies that the systems described here are capable of performing purposeful behaviors in the real world. They obtain inputs from the world through sensors and act upon the world through actuators. The connection between sensing and actuation may be simple signal processing or it may involve complex decision making, goal interpretation and other aspects of reasoning. Most autonomous systems display some form of mobility: on land, under water, in the air or in space. The mobility may make use of wheels, legs, fins, rotors or other actuators. The focus is on the ability to move and be self-sufficient, not on whether the system is an imitation of biology. Of course, biological models for robotic systems are of major interest to the journal since living systems are prototypes for autonomous behavior.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18016&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18016\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Internet is the core of today's computer-communication infrastructures. This has transformed the Internet, from a robust network for data transfer between computers, to a global, content-rich, communication and information system where contents are increasingly generated by the users, and distributed according to human social relations. Next-generation network technologies, architectures and protocols are therefore required to overcome the limitations of the legacy Internet and add new capabilities and services. The future Internet should be ubiquitous, secure, resilient, and closer to human communication paradigms. Computer Communications is a peer-reviewed international journal that publishes high-quality scientific articles (both theory and practice) and survey papers covering all aspects of future computer communication networks (on all layers, except the physical layer), with a special attention to the evolution of the Internet architecture, protocols, services, and applications.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=13681&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=13681\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It intends to encourage and facilitate cooperation and interaction among IEEE Societies with systems-level and systems engineering interest, and to attract non-IEEE contributors and readers from around the globe. Our IEEE Systems Council job is to address issues in new ways that are not solvable in the domains of the existing IEEE or other societies or global organizations. These problems do not fit within traditional hierarchical boundaries. For example, disaster response such as that triggered by Hurricane Katrina, tsunamis, or current volcanic eruptions is not solvable by pure engineering solutions. We need to think about changing and enlarging the paradigm to include systems issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11300153734&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11300153734\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We publish the highest quality empirical, theoretically grounded work addressing the main functions of higher education and the dynamic role of the university in society. We seek to publish scholarship from a wide variety of theoretical perspectives and disciplinary orientations. Articles appearing in the Journal employ an array of methodological approaches, and we welcome work from scholars across a range of career stages. Comparative and international scholarship should make clear connections to the U.S. context. Manuscripts not appropriate for submission to the Journal include purely theoretical papers, methodological treatises, unsolicited essays and reviews, and non-academic, institutional, and program evaluations or reports.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19490&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19490\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
