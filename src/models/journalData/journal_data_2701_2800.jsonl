The Journal is concerned with all aspects of the criminal justice system in terms of their relationships to each other. Although materials are presented relating to crime and the individual elements of the criminal justice system, the emphasis of the Journal is to tie together the functioning of these elements and to illustrate the effects of their interactions. Articles that reflect the application of new disciplines or analytical methodologies to the problems of criminal justice are of special interest. Since the purpose of the Journal is to provide a forum for the dissemination of new ideas, new information, and the application of new methods to the problems and functions of the criminal justice system, the Journal emphasizes innovation and creative thought of the highest quality.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied

The journal is dedicated to publishing high-quality original research articles and survey articles in which combinatorics and physics interact in both directions. Combinatorial papers should be motivated by potential applications to physical phenomena or models, while physics papers should contain some interesting combinatorial development. Both rigorous mathematical proof and heuristic physical reasoning have a place in this journal, but each must be clearly labeled. Definitions and proofs should be presented with the precision and rigor that are expected in a mathematics journal. Conjectures based on heuristic physical arguments and/or numerical evidence are warmly encouraged, but they should be clearly labeled as such and should be stated as precisely as possible. Authors should remember that readers of the journal will come from a wide variety of backgrounds, both mathematical (not only combinatorics but also algebra, topology, geometry, analysis, probability, etc) and physical (quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, quantum gravity etc). Therefore, authors should write with such a diverse audience in mind and should take care to provide, in the introductory section of their article, a clear statement of the problem to be studied and the mathematical and/or physical background from which it arises. Authors are also encouraged to provide, in the second section of the article, a brief pedagogical review of the mathematical or physical tools that will be used in their work.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Algebra and Number Theory","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100829708&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100829708\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

As a result, the journal concentrates on papers of an academic journal standard but aimed at the practitioner as much as the academic. High quality contributions are therefore welcomed from both academics and professionals working in the field of logistics and supply chain management. Papers should further our understanding of logistics and supply chain management and make a significant original contribution to knowledge. In this context the term ’logistics’ is taken in its broadest context as \"the management of processes, flow of materials and associated information along the entire supply chain, from raw materials through to the final user of the product\".","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International

There is appreciation for the application of cellular, biochemical, molecular and in vivo genetic approaches, as well as the power of genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and systems biology. In particular, the Journal encourages submission of high-interest papers investigating the genetic and epigenetic regulation of proliferation and phenotype as well as cell fate and lineage commitment by growth factors, cytokines and their cognate receptors and signal transduction pathways that influence the expression, integration and activities of these physiological mediators. Similarly, the Journal encourages submission of manuscripts exploring the regulation of growth and differentiation by cell adhesion molecules in addition to the interplay between these processes and those induced by growth factors and cytokines. Studies on the genes and processes that regulate cell cycle progression and phase transition in eukaryotic cells, and the mechanisms that determine whether cells enter quiescence, proliferate or undergo apoptosis are also welcomed. Submission of papers that address contributions of the extracellular matrix to cellular phenotypes and physiological control as well as regulatory mechanisms governing fertilization, embryogenesis, gametogenesis, cell fate, lineage commitment, differentiation, development and dynamic parameters of cell motility are encouraged. Finally, the investigation of stem cells and changes that differentiate cancer cells from normal cells including studies on the properties and functions of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes will remain as one of the major interests of the Journal.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell

It also publishes surveys of research progress and specialized articles devoted to summarizing particular recent developments. The aim is to address the need brought about by the literature on the chemistry of the solid state being widely dispersed, making it difficult to obtain a broad and unified assessment of the present state of knowledge. Special emphasis is given to relating physical properties and structural chemistry. Whereas structural chemistry at one time was concerned mostly with perfect solids, most activity focused upon understanding of solid properties focuses on imperfections. Entities such as vacancies, dislocations, and positive holes, which have no independent existence outside the solid itself, are of prime importance in modern solid state chemistry.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Condensed Matter Physics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Condensed Matter Physics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Condensed

TLCR is indexed by SCIE, PubMed/PubMed Central, Scopus and the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Databases. It is published quarterly the first year, and published bimonthly since February 2013. It provides practical up-to-date information on prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer. Specific areas of its interest include, but not limited to, multimodality therapy, markers, imaging, tumor biology, pathology, chemoprevention, and technical advances related to lung cancer. TLCR is dedicated to focus on cutting-edge developments at the transition from preclinical to clinical research and thus closes the gap between “bench and bedside”. The aim of TLCR is to provide a forum for the dissemination of original research and review articles in all areas related to lung cancer, as well as a timely platform for the exchange of key opinions between leading experts, and so to provide readers with a novel, well-organized, informative, enlightening and educational journal. TLCR features a distinguished editorial board, which brings together a team of highly experienced specialists in lung cancer. The diverse experience of the board members allows our editorial panel to lend their expertise to a broad spectrum of lung cancer subjects. The entire submission and review process are managed through the OJS system, an electronic journal system which offers an efficient way and ensures a rapid turnaround of papers submitted for publication. Articles will be published both in print and online.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100448905&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100448905\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This includes analyses of genome-scale datasets and the development of methods, which are likely best fit for the Research Article format. Brief communications about genome evolution, methods and software (including updates) can be published as Letters. The journal also publishes Perspectives and Reviews. Finally, we accept short Genome Reports that present newly-generated genomic data. All manuscripts should be initially submitted as a single PDF, ideally with tables and figures included within the main text at the point where they are referred to (separate submission of editable text and tables and high quality images will be required for all manuscripts on first revision, see here for more). Line numbers (consecutive) should be included. Manuscripts considered for publication report evolutionary findings that concern natural genome diversity, population genomics, the structure, function, organisation and expression of genomes, comparative genomics, proteomics, and environmental genomic interactions. Major evolutionary insights from the fields of computational biology, structural biology, developmental biology, and cell biology are also considered, as are theoretical advances in the field of genome evolution. Relevant methods and software programs addressing these topics are also appropriate. GBE’s scope embraces genome-wide evolutionary investigations at all taxonomic levels and for all forms of life—within populations or across domains. Its aims are to further the understanding of genomes in their evolutionary context and further the understanding of evolution from a genome-wide perspective.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700182013&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700182013\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Articles reporting the construction of new measures or an advancement of an existing measure are given priority. The journal is directed to practitioners as well as to academicians: The conviction of its editors is that the discipline of psychological assessment should, necessarily and firmly, be attached to the roots of psychological science, while going deeply into all the consequences of its applied, practice-oriented development. Psychological assessment is experiencing a period of renewal and expansion, attracting more and more attention from both academic and applied psychology, as well as from political, corporate, and social organizations. The EJPA provides a meeting point for this movement, contributing to the scientific development of psychological assessment and to communication between professionals and researchers in Europe and worldwide. The journal presents clearly written original papers, reviews, and case studies in all domains of psychological assessment.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=14107&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=14107\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Society was founded in 1954 and is now incorporated as a non-profit educational and scientific institution. With participation encompassing 100 countries, ISES® serves as a centre for information on research and development in solar energy utilisation. Through its publications and its sponsorship of technical conferences, the Society provides a world forum for the active consideration of solar energy. Solar Energy welcomes manuscripts presenting information not previously published in journals on any aspect of solar energy research, development, application, measurement or policy. The term \"solar energy\" in this context includes the indirect uses such as wind energy and biomass. Because of the international character of Solar Energy, articles that deal solely with the solar radiation or wind data base of a specific country are not normally considered suitable for Solar Energy. Submitted manuscripts may take the form of reports of original studies or reviews of significant prior work in a given area. All manuscripts are subject to reviews to assure accuracy, clarity, and long-term value.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=13333&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=13333\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Of particular interest are papers that can make definitive statements about a given topic (thereby having implications for the standards of clinical practice) and those with the potential to expand today’s clinical frontiers (e.g., introduction of a disorder that is typically not under the purview of clinical neuropsychology, yet presents with neurocognitive sequelae; introduction of new assessment or intervention tools).

Recognizing the importance of the service sector across the globe, the journal encourages submissions from and/or studying issues from around the world. JSTP gives prominence to research based on real world data, be it quantitative or qualitative. The journal also encourages the submission of strong conceptual and theoretical papers that make a substantive contribution to the scholarly literature in service management. JSTP publishes double-blind peer reviewed papers and encourages submissions from both academics and practitioners. The changing social structures and values, as well as new developments in economic, political, and technological fields are creating sea-changes in the philosophy, strategic aims, operational practices, and structures of many organizations. These changes are particularly relevant to the service sector, as public demand for high standards increases, and organizations fight for both market share and public credibility. The journal specifically addresses solutions to these challenges from a global, multi-cultural, and multi-disciplinary perspective.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100407241&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100407241\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
