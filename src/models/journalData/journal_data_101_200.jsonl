Both qualitative (narrative) and quantitative (meta-analytic) reviews will be considered, depending on the nature of the database under consideration for review. Integrative reviews or research syntheses focus on empirical studies and seek to summarize past research by drawing overall conclusions from many separate investigations that address related or identical hypotheses. A research synthesis typically presents the authors' assessments of the state of knowledge concerning the relations of interest;critical assessments of the strengths and weaknesses in past research; andimportant issues that research has left unresolved, thereby directing future research so it can yield a maximum amount of new information. Both cumulative and historical approaches (i.e., ones that organize a research literature by highlighting temporally unfolding developments in a field) can be used. Integrative research reviews that develop connections between areas of research are particularly valuable. Manuscripts dealing with topics at the interface of psychological sciences and society are welcome, as are evaluations of applied psychological therapies, programs, and interventions. Expository articles may be published if they are deemed accurate, broad, clear, and pertinent. Methodological articles that previously were submitted to Psychological Bulletin should now be submitted to Psychological Methods. Original theoretical articles should be submitted to Psychological Review, even when they include summaries of research. Research syntheses should be submitted to Psychological Bulletin even when they develop integrated theoretical statements.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"History and Philosophy of Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=13443&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=13443\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal's mission is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and concepts between scientists studying the microbe with those studying the host immune, cell biological, and molecular response upon colonization or infection by a microbe. Cell Host & Microbe will publish novel findings related to microbes (which includes bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) from molecular and cellular biology to translational studies with particular emphasis on the interface between the microbe and its host (vertebrate, invertebrate, or plant; unicellular or multicellular). The unifying theme is the integrated study of microbes (pathogenic, non-pathogenic, and commensal) in conjunction and communication with each other, their host, and the cellular environment they inhabit. Work published in Cell Host & Microbe is expected not only to be of exceptional significance within its field, but also of interest to researchers outside the immediate area. In addition to primary research manuscripts, Cell Host & Microbe will publish expert analysis, commentary, and reviews on topics of current interest in the field. Topics covered include: - Molecular and cell biology of microbes - Microbial pathogenesis - Host cellular and immune response to microbes - Immune evasion - Therapeutics - Evolution, epidemiology, and natural history of microbes - Vaccine design, development, and trials - Emerging pathogens","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer

Living Reviews is unique in maintaining a suite of high-quality reviews, which are kept up-to-date by the authors. This is the meaning of the word \"living\" in the journal's title. Living Reviews in Solar Physics attracts readers from the entire solar and heliospheric physics community. Graduate students can use the journal to start their initial literature surveys or to learn about fields peripheral to their own; researchers can use it to quickly find out about the most up-to-date results in fields in which they are not current, to track down bibliographic references that they have not recorded, or even to find areas in which their own skills can be applied in a new field; and lecturers can use it to find information and visual materials that can be used in presentations at all levels.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Space and Planetary Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700173023&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700173023\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

As well as reflecting the traditional core subjects of analytical, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry, the journal also features a broad range of chemical research including, but not limited to, catalysis, computational and theoretical chemistry, environmental chemistry, green chemistry, medicinal chemistry, nuclear chemistry, polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry and surface chemistry. Other cross-disciplinary topics such as bioinorganic, bioorganic, organometallic and physicalâorganic chemistry will also be featured. The submission of manuscripts detailing multidisciplinary research performed at the interface of chemistry and other scientific fields of inquiry such as biology, materials science, nanotechnology and physics is also encouraged, where the central theme of the work â and the major advances that are reported â fall within the bounds of chemistry. In addition to primary research, Nature Chemistry also publishes review articles, news and views, research highlights about important work reported in other journals, commentaries, book reviews, correspondence, and analysis of the broader chemical picture beyond the laboratory â including issues such as education, funding, policy, intellectual property, and the impact chemistry has on society. In this way, the journal aims to be the voice of the worldwide chemical community. Nature Chemistry is committed to publishing top-tier original research in all areas of chemistry through a fair and rigorous review process. It offers authors high visibility for their papers, access to a broad readership, high standards of copy editing and production, rapid publication and independence from academic societies and others with vested interests.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18100156701&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18100156701\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The reviews, both experimental and theoretical, provide general background information as well as a critical assessment on topics in a state of flux. The editorial policy of Materials Science & Engineering R: Reports is to serve its readership in two ways. Firstly, it provides a critical overview of the current issues in a well-defined area of immediate interest to materials scientists. Secondly, each review contains an extensive list of references thus providing an invaluable pointer to the primary research literature available on the topic. This policy is implemented by the Editorial Board which consists of outstanding scientists in their respective disciplines. The Board identifies the topics of interest and subsequently invites qualified authors. In order to ensure speedy publication, each review is published separately.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Condensed Matter Physics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Condensed Matter

One type addresses questions about existing quantitative and qualitative methods and research designs currently used by organizational researchers and may involve a comparison of alternative methods. Articles of this nature should focus on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the analytical technique(s) presented. A second type demonstrates how refinements to existing quantitative or qualitative methods might lead to advances in researchersâ ability to test and propose theory. For submissions of this type, authors should clearly delineate how the refinement differs from current practice and how the refinement has the potential to advance theory. A third type introduces methodological developments or techniques from other disciplines to organizational researchers. For these articles, the relative advantages of the new techniques should be clearly discussed. A fourth type may introduce new methodological and statistical procedures and concepts. Manuscripts that primarily apply research methods to substantive problems are not encouraged.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Decision Sciences

Each report deals with one specific subject and is generally published in a separate volume. These reviews are specialist in nature but contain enough introductory material to make the main points intelligible to a non-specialist. The reader will not only be able to distinguish important developments and trends in physics but will also find a sufficient number of references to the original literature. The Editors of Physics Reports are specialized in the areas: Astrophysics and Cosmology; Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; Biological Physics; Condensed Matter Physics; High Energy Physics; Nanoscience; Non-Linear Dynamics and Complex Systems; Nuclear Physics and Hadronic Physics; Plasma Physics; and Statistical Physics.

Consistently ranked as one of the top journals by Impact Factor, Article Influence Score and more, the journal serves as a trusted resource for engineers around the world. The Proceedings publishes approximately ten Special Issues and two regular paper issues per year. -Special Issues are led by distinguished Guest Editor teams and contain articles, typically surveys, reviews or tutorials, from leading experts in the technology area being covered. They serve as a guide to the state-of-the-art and are highly valued by the core research community, as well as specialists in other areas, looking to quickly come up to speed on the latest and more promising advances in areas outside of their own expertise. -Regular Issues consist of three to four papers on more focused topics, giving readers background and insight into emerging areas. Papers published in the Proceedings are usually reviews, surveys, or tutorials. -Reviews critically examine a technology, tracing its progress from its inception to the presentâand perhaps into the future. -Surveys comprehensively view a technologyâits applications, issues, ramifications, and potential. -Tutorial papers explain a technology and may give practical information for implementing it. These papers are written for the purpose of informing non-specialist engineers about a particular technology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17915&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17915\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Occasionally, PECS solicits short Perspectives to highlight recent successes, current developments, and future research needs in energy and combustion science. While PECS spans the broad field of energy science, it focuses particularly on the fields of combustion and fuel science. Combustion has played an important role in the world's energy systems and will continue to do so in years to come. As time passes, technological demands evolve and change. For instance, the challenges we face today include conservation of energy, addressing the problem of global climate change, and environmental concerns, and together these require more efficient and cleaner combustion. Beyond energy, combustion plays an important role in process technology and materials science. PECS publishes reviews on all such topics, including concepts, methodologies, processes, and technology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemical Engineering

How do humans perceive, think, feel, decide, and act? How do they interact with their environments and others? How do these abilities develop and decline over the lifespan? How do they evolve and compare with other species? How do they vary among individuals, groups, and cultures? How are they shaped by socioeconomic and political factors? How are they affected by disease or deprivation? What interventions can influence individual behaviours or outcomes? The journal welcomes research from any discipline that provides significant original insight into these questions. Nature Human Behaviour features a broad range of topics, including (but not limited to) perception, action, memory, learning, reward, judgment, decision-making, language, communication, emotion, personality, social cognition, social behaviour, neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental/neurological disorders, economic & political behaviour, belief systems, social networks, social norms, social structures, behaviour change, collective cognition and behaviour, culture, public policy.
