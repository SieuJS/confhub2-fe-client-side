In particular, the journal welcomes theoretical and computational papers that have empirical orientation, such as work on identification or estimation and computational techniques with practical interest. Quantitative Economics aims at covering a variety of applied fields, including labor economics, industrial organization, development and growth economics, macroeconomics, international economics, public finance and social economics. The editorial board is especially interested in providing a forum for papers that are innovative beyond established types of analysis, for papers that are willing to challenge conventional ways of conducting empirically oriented work, and for papers that build new bridges across fields. Quantitative Economics’ editorial board strives to reduce the length of the editorial process, keeping at a minimum multiple revisions and trying to avoid delays while maintaining the highest standards in the editorial process. Most submitted articles are refereed carefully at Quantitative Economics. Nevertheless, some papers are rejected after having been read by a member of the editorial board but without providing detailed reports. This is intended as a service to authors to avoid them waiting when papers are clearly not suitable, and also to save on the scarce resource of referees. An international board of editors, together with the generous help of many referees, works hard to maintain the deep and timely reviews, thereby encouraging submissions of the highest quality. We strongly encourage recent Ph. D. graduates to submit their work to Quantitative Economics. Our policy is to take into account the fact that recent graduates are less experienced in the process of writing and submitting papers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100255526&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100255526\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The scope of acceptable articles should embrace any research methodology and any accounting-related subject, as long as the articles meet the standards established for publication in the journal … No special sections should be necessary. The primary, but not exclusive, audience should be—as it is now—academicians, graduate students, and others interested in accounting research.” The primary criterion for publication in The Accounting Review is the significance of the contribution an article makes to the literature. Topical areas of interest to the journal include accounting information systems, auditing and assurance services, financial accounting, management accounting, taxation, and all other areas of accounting, broadly defined. The journal is also open to all rigorous research methods.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28096&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

As an open access and open-data journal, we publish ALL research objects (data, software tools and workflows) from 'big data' studies across the entire spectrum of life and biomedical sciences. These resources are managed using the FAIR Principles for scientific data management and stewardship that state that research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. To achieve our goals, the journal has a novel publication format: one that links standard manuscript publication with an extensive database that hosts all associated data and provides data analysis tools and cloud-computing resources. GigaDB provides a direct link between the published manuscript and the relevant supporting data. We have also built GigaGalaxy, a Galaxy-based data analysis platform to host computational methods and workflows, maximizing use of the data, tools and workflows in our papers in a more accessible and reproducible environment. Our scope covers not just 'omic' type data and the fields of high-throughput biology currently serviced by large public repositories, but also the growing range of more difficult-to-access data, such as imaging, neuroscience, ecology, cohort data, systems biology and other new types of large-scale shareable data.

Topics explored by AJHG include behavioral genetics, biochemical genetics, clinical genetics, cytogenetics, dysmorphology, gene therapy, genetic counseling, genetic epidemiology, genomics, immunogenetics, molecular genetics, neurogenetics, and population genetics. AJHG welcomes submissions of articles and reports on timely subjects concerning all aspects of human genetics, including studies of model organisms that are of direct relevance to human genetics. Manuscripts should be written in a manner accessible to investigators representing diverse backgrounds in human genetics. Descriptions of new statistical methods of general interest to the genetics community are welcome. New methods should be compared to existing methods with the use of real data and/or simulations with parameters (e.g., haplotype frequencies, effect sizes) that are based on a real data example (e.g., marker or haplotype data from the HapMap project). All novel computer programs must be made publicly available by the time that the manuscript is published, and a URL for the website must be included in the Web Resources section of the manuscript. Letters commenting on material previously published in AJHG are also welcome. AJHG does not publish reports of either single mutations or mutational surveys of previously identified loci unless they have unusual significance and substantial insight. Descriptions of new linkage assignments will be considered only if they are of special interest. Reports of negative data will not normally be considered.

The monthly journal provides readers with context and insight into the clinical advances and practice-changing research shaping the study of HIV/AIDS today. Now is a critical moment in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Despite the world view that the end of AIDS may be within reach, the job of controlling this epidemic is certainly not done. As HIV disease evolves to become a chronic infection, the interaction of the virus with other chronic conditions will present a host of new challenges. The Lancet HIV is a journal for a new era in the history of HIV/AIDS. The Lancet HIV builds on The Lancet journals' reputation for publishing HIV/AIDS research to provide a reliable foundation for advocacy and for programmatic and political change. We will consider clinical, epidemiological, operational, and implementation research, unifying these disciplines across a single vision for the health of those living with HIV.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Virology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100369870&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100369870\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The unique goal of Health Affairs is to incorporate in one publication the diverse viewpoints and perspectives of the health sphere–industry, labor, government, and academe–in a way that benefits everyone who reads it.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=20833&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=20833\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal has also published informative articles on specific aspects of qualitative research processes such as ethics, transcription, and interviewee recruitment, and helped to promote innovative research techniques such as photovoice, autoethnography, template analysis, and psychogeography. Our audience consists of psychology professionals using qualitative methods of inquiry in research in academic, clinical, or occupational settings.

The objective of papers should be to contribute to the understanding of statistical methodology and/or to develop and improve statistical methods; any mathematical theory should be directed towards these aims. The kinds of contribution considered include descriptions of new methods of collecting or analysing data, with the underlying theory, an indication of the scope of application and preferably a real example. Also considered are comparisons, critical evaluations and new applications of existing methods, contributions to probability theory which have a clear practical bearing (including the formulation and analysis of stochastic models), statistical computation or simulation where original methodology is involved and original contributions to the foundations of statistical science. Reviews of methodological techniques are also considered. A paper, even if correct and well presented, is likely to be rejected if it only presents straightforward special cases of previously published work, if it is of mathematical interest only, if it is too long in relation to the importance of the new material that it contains or if it is dominated by computations or simulations of a routine nature.

Our broad research remit aims to encompass early-stage clinical research into the mechanisms of ageing at any stage of life through to epidemiological and societal research on changing populations, including clinical trials in all disciplines focused, but not exclusively, on older people, gerontological science, and age-specific clinical guidelines. We also publish clinical and policy reviews, which aim to shape and contextualise the debate on this fast-growing discipline. The Lancet Healthy Longevity continues in The Lancet Group’s tradition of being a strong advocate for the rights of all people to healthy, fulfilling lives, irrespective of age, and prioritises reports of original research that are likely to change clinical practice or thinking. Cassandra Coburn, Editor-in-Chief, further shares her ambitions for the journal. We publish a range of content types including Articles, Review, Comment, and Correspondence.

Studies must concern biological systems, regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial, and managed or natural environments. Both biological responses and feedbacks to change are included, and may be considered at any level of organization from molecular to biome. Studies may employ theoretical, modeling, analytical, experimental, observational, and historical approaches and should be exploratory rather than confirmatory. GCB publishes primary research articles, technical advances, research reviews, commentaries and letters. Global Change Biology defines global change as any consistent trend in the environment - past, present or projected - that affects a substantial part of the globe. Examples include: rising tropospheric ozone, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide concentrations; increasing UV-B irradiation; global climate change; biological sinks and sources of atmospheric trace gases; eutrophication; land use change; loss of biodiversity; biological feedback on climate change; biological mitigation for atmospheric

The term coordination chemistry is interpreted broadly, and includes aspects of organometallic, supramolecular, theoretical, and bioinorganic chemistry. The journal also publishes review articles on catalysis, materials chemistry and metal-organic frameworks which focus on the coordination chemistry aspects of these topics. In general, the reviews survey developments in a particular area during the last few years, or discuss the results obtained with a particular technique. We welcome reviews both from established researchers and excellent younger chemists. Special issues are published from time to time on topics of current interest and importance. These special issues may also focus on contributions from a specific country or area of the world, or contain the proceedings of invited lectures to major international conferences. Full book length articles also appear occasionally. The journal also incorporates special volumes containing annual reviews of main group chemistry, on transition metal group chemistry, and on organometallic chemistry. Excellent reviews are essential educational tools for those working in the area of coordination chemistry. Coordination Chemistry Reviews will continue to act as a focal point for informative critical surveys of inorganic and physical inorganic chemistry.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Inorganic Chemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Inorganic Chemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Inorganic Chemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Inorganic Chemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Inorganic Chemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Inorganic Chemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Inorganic Chemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23470&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23470\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The field of autophagy has advanced tremendously, due in large part to the multiple connections between autophagy and various aspects of human health and disease including cancer, neurodegeneration, aging, diabetes, myopathies and heart disease. Our goal is to be the premiere journal in this field, publishing papers that you want read by the people in your research group. Autophagy publishes several types of papers including: Original research (basic science, translational and clinical), reviews (both comprehensive overviews and short puncta), technical papers (toolbox, protocol and resource), commentaries, and articles on science and art. Reviews, puncta and commentaries will generally be invited. We also anticipate special issues that are devoted to particular areas of research. Suggestions for appropriate specialized topics are welcome. We are interested in all experimental systems, from yeast to human. All submitted manuscripts are initially reviewed by the editors, and, if considered suitable for further consideration, are sent out for peer review by independent, anonymous expert referees; we generally seek a minimum of two reviews whenever possible. Accepted papers go through a rigorous editing process that results in very high-quality content.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=3900148405&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=3900148405\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
