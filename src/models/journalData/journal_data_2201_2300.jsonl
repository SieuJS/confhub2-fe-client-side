We define experimental methods broadly: research featuring random (or quasi-random) assignment of subjects to different treatments in an effort to isolate causal relationships in the sphere of politics. JEPS embraces all of the different types of experiments carried out as part of political science research, including survey experiments, laboratory experiments, field experiments, lab experiments in the field, natural and neurological experiments. We invite authors to submit concise articles (around 4000 words or fewer) that immediately address the subject of the research. We do not require lengthy explanations regarding and justifications of the experimental method. Nor do we expect extensive literature reviews of pros and cons of the methodological approaches involved in the experiment unless the goal of the article is to explore these methodological issues. We expect readers to be familiar with experimental methods and therefore to not need pages of literature reviews to be convinced that experimental methods are a legitimate methodological approach. We will consider longer articles in rare, but appropriate cases, as in the following examples: when a new experimental method or approach is being introduced and discussed or when novel theoretical results are being evaluated through experimentation. Finally, we strongly encourage authors to submit manuscripts that showcase informative null findings or inconsistent results from well-designed, executed, and analyzed experiments.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100835891&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100835891\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Over the last decade, it has become clear that empirical studies are a fundamental component of software engineering research and practice: Software development practices and technologies must be investigated by empirical means in order to be understood, evaluated, and deployed in proper contexts. This stems from the observation that higher software quality and productivity is more likely to be achieved if well-understood, tested practices and technologies are introduced in software development. Reported empirical studies usually involve the collection and analysis of data and experience that can be used to characterize, evaluate and reveal relationships between software development deliverables, practices, and technologies. Over time, it is expected that such empirical results will form a body of knowledge leading to widely accepted and well-formed theories.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Software","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18650&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18650\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Devoted to the advancement of socio-economics, it deals with the analytical, political and moral questions arising at the intersection between economy and society. Articles in SER explore how the economy is or should be governed by social relations, institutional rules, political decisions, and cultural values. They also consider how the economy in turn affects the society of which it is part, for example by breaking up old institutional forms and giving rise to new ones. The domain of the journal is deliberately broadly conceived, so new variations to its general theme may be discovered and editors can learn from the papers that readers submit. To enhance international dialogue, Socio-Economic Review accepts the submission of translated articles that are simultaneously published in a language other than English. In pursuit of its program, SER is eager to promote interdisciplinary dialogue between sociology, economics, political science and moral philosophy, through both empirical and theoretical work. Empirical papers may be qualitative as well as quantitative, and theoretical papers will not be confined to deductive model-building. Papers suggestive of more generalizable insights into the economy as a domain of social action will be preferred over narrowly specialized work. While firmly committed to the highest standards of scholarly excellence, Socio-Economic Review encourages discussion of the practical and ethical dimensions of economic action, with the intention to contribute to both the advancement of social science and the building of a good economy in a good society.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=26796&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=26796\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Before 1989, the core of comparative economics was the comparison of economic systems with in particular the economic analysis of socialism in its different forms. In the last fifteen years, the main focus of interest of comparative economists has been the transition from socialism to capitalism. In recent years, mostly as a result of the transition experience, a new orientation of comparative economics has emerged that focuses on the comparison of the economic effects of the various institutions of capitalism, be it in the legal sphere (common law versus civil law), in the political sphere (different types of democracies and electoral regimes) or in the sphere of culture, social norms, etc. This new orientation is a natural development following the very diverse experience of transitions from socialism to capitalism. The transition experience has indeed shown with a vengeance the importance of institutions in the process of economic development.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23861&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23861\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is the official publication of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR). With an international Editorial Board comprising leading scholars, it is the first journal dedicated to research into the challenges of collecting, analysing and reporting data with the specific intent to improve learning. “Learning” is broadly defined across a range of contexts, including informal learning on the internet, formal academic study in institutions (primary/secondary/tertiary), and workplace learning. The journal seeks to connect learning analytics researchers, developers and practitioners who share the common interest in using data traces to better understand and improve learning through the creation and implementation of new tools and techniques and the study of transformations they engender. The interdisciplinary focus of the journal recognizes that computational, pedagogical, institutional, policy and social perspectives must be brought into dialogue with each other to ensure that interventions and organizational systems serve the needs of all stakeholders. Together, these communities each bring a valuable lens to provide ongoing input, evaluation and critique of the conceptual, technical, and practical advances of the field.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100932472&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100932472\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal focuses on records of the past and current state of the earth system, and future scenarios , and their link to global environmental change. Regional or process-oriented studies are welcome if they discuss global implications. Topics include, but are not limited to, changes in the dynamics and composition of the atmosphere, oceans and cryosphere, as well as climate change, sea level variation, observations/modelling of Earth processes from deep to (near-)surface and their coupling, global ecology, biogeography and the resilience/thresholds in ecosystems. Key criteria for the consideration of manuscripts are (a) the relevance for the global scientific community and/or (b) the wider implications for global scale problems, preferably combined with (c) having a significance beyond a single discipline. A clear focus on key processes associated with planetary scale change is strongly encouraged. Manuscripts can be submitted as either research contributions or as a review article. Every effort should be made towards the presentation of research outcomes in an understandable way for a broad readership.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27049&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=27049\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is the destination for rapid communication from acceptance to publication of quality research on transportation, and publishes research articles, case studies, research notes, tutorials and opinion pieces. It particularly welcomes articles reporting negative or controversial results and new (and less mature) ideas. Articles are relevant to both academics and practitioners, and are the results of anonymous reviews by at least two referees chosen by the editor for their specialist knowledge. TRIP aims for rapid review. TRIP welcomes papers of many kinds, including those where: - the research is multi-disciplinary and straddles Transportation Research Parts A–F; - the research is novel, untested, integrative, promising and lacks an established venue for publication; - the research uses novel methods or mixed methods; - the research is policy or practice oriented; - the research focuses on education, training and curriculum development; - the research includes and supports efforts in low income developing countries; - case studies and evaluations of local, state and provincial transportation projects are welcome; - the work of consultants, industry, think tanks and government agencies is highlighted; - summaries of presentations made at international conferences and workshops as well as Elsevier sponsored events; - TRIP also welcomes editorial think pieces which focus on transportation research needs and developments and advocacy for improved research; - share best practices in terms of research methods, data access, reporting and management.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100943534&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100943534\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Serving an expanding multidisciplinary community of researchers and technologists, our goal is to develop a selective journal dedicated to bringing together the most important new results and perspectives from across the discipline.

It aims to address not only economic analysis and policy but also the intersection between economics, development, and area studies. In doing so, it plays an important role in helping the world—including Indonesians themselves—to better understand Indonesia. BIES has been published continuously since 1965. The editors welcome original papers and notes in economics, political economy, and related fields such as law and public policy, political science, demography, geography, the environment, education, and health. Regardless of topic or methodology, the primary focus must be Indonesia. The editors also look to publish discursive book reviews and review essays that contribute to the literature. BIES authors benefit from rigorous double-blind peer review, robust editing, free-access initiatives, a supportive self-archiving policy, and assistance in promoting their article after publication. The journal’s longstanding reputation as a well-respected outlet for high-quality research means each issue is read widely by Indonesianists everywhere. The journal’s practice of publishing article abstracts in both English and Bahasa Indonesia has increased the number of potential readers. In addition to the usual articles reporting economic analysis and research, each issue leads with an instalment of the comprehensive Survey of Recent Developments series, which records and analyses current trends, policy changes, and important economic events in Indonesia. The series aims to be reasonably accessible to non-specialists, and helps to account for the journal’s diverse readership within academia, government, and business and among the broader public.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19966&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19966\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Coverage includes both cognitive evaluations of life such as life-satisfaction, and affective enjoyment of life, such as mood level. In addition to contributions on appraisal of life-as-a-whole, the journal accepts papers on such life domains as job-satisfaction, and such life-aspects as the perceived meaning of life. The Journal of Happiness Studies provides a forum for two main traditions in happiness research: 1) speculative reflection on the good life, and 2) empirical investigation of subjective well-being. Contributions span a broad range of disciplines: alpha-sciences, philosophy in particular; beta-sciences, especially investigations about the biological and physiological correlates of happiness and well-being; and gamma-sciences, including not only psychology and sociology but also economics. The journal addresses the conceptualization, measurement, prevalence, explanation, evaluation, imagination and study of happiness.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=144820&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=144820\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal aims to promote original works that demonstrate significant progress beyond the current state of the art in these fields along with applicability to solve meaningful analytical problems. Review articles may only be submitted upon invitation from an Editor of the journal. The journal aims to publish works that are supported by experimental results and as such purely theoretical works are not accepted. The analytical performance in all analytical parameters needs to be reported and critically compared with the state of the art. Sensing applications will be considered only if they refer to analytically challenging complex samples and are properly validated. The scope of the journal encompasses, but is not restricted to, the following areas: • Novel chemical sensing and biosensing concepts, mechanisms and detection principles • Development of chemical sensors and biosensors • Fabrication technology of chemical sensors, biosensors, chip-based detection devices and chemical actuators • Chemical actuators including soft actuators, micro- and nanomotors, microfluidic components • Photonic and biophotonic sensors and chemical sensing systems • Lab-on-a-chip, Micro Total Analysis Systems (µTAS) and other biochips and microarray systems •
