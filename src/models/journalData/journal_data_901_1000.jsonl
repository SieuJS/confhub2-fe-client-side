During the last few decades, an overwhelming amount of data has become available and a panoply of discoveries has been made. It is almost impossible to keep up to date on current developments in these areas. Moreover, there is a definite need to extract the quintessence out of this information, to synthesise the research progress and to identify the achieved advances in science and technology. This is the rationale behind the journal Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology. The journal has two distinct peer-reviewed sections: a section containing mini-reviews (up to 8 printed pages), expressing scientific opinions on topics and trends as well as a Reviews section (up to 30 printed pages) containing comprehensive critical evaluations of research efforts and technical realizations in particular areas. In addition to (mini-)review papers, the journal reports on newly initiated research projects in a distinct Project Update and Science Career section, focusing on initiatives from large research consortia and young researchers, respectively. The horizon paper, SWITCH monitor and Stockholm Water Perspectives sections provide research and policy-oriented commentaries from world renowned leaders in environmental science and (bio)technology research. The Web Alert section hints readers on key websites, whereas the Symposium Watch section updates them on the most recent developments in the field presented on international workshops, seminars and symposia. The journal also features special issues focusing on topics of international concern.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Microbiology and

The journal is a vehicle for dissemination of these resources, targeting a wide audience of researchers in the fields of evolution, ecology, and conservation. Articles in Molecular Ecology Resources are intended to facilitate studies addressing consequential questions in these fields. In addition to novel resource articles, Molecular Ecology Resources publishes relevant Reviews, Opinions, and Comments. The journal also publishes occasional Special Issues that emphasize development of resources in a particular area. Papers that report on empirical research in ecology, evolution, behavior, and conservation, rather than new resources and tools, should be submitted to our companion journal, Molecular Ecology. Papers that are primarily descriptive and relevant only to the taxon being studied without addressing a question more broadly applicable in ecology are not appropriate for Molecular Ecology and should instead be submitted to a more specialized journal or to Ecology & Evolution.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology,

The journal strives to be essential reading for structural biologists, as well as biologists and biochemists that are interested in macromolecular structure and function. Structure strongly encourages the submission of manuscripts that present structural and molecular insights into biological function and mechanism. Other reports that address fundamental questions in structural biology, such as structure-based examinations of protein evolution, folding, and/or design, will also be considered. We will consider the application of any method, experimental or computational, at high or low resolution, to conduct structural investigations, as long as the method is appropriate for the biological, functional, and mechanistic question(s) being addressed. Likewise, reports describing single-molecule analysis of biological mechanisms are welcome. In general, the editors encourage submission of experimental structural studies that are enriched by an analysis of structure-activity relationships and will not consider studies that solely report structural information unless the structure or analysis is of exceptional and broad interest. Studies reporting only homology models, de novo models, or molecular dynamics simulations are also discouraged unless the models are informed by or validated by novel experimental data; rationalization of a large body of existing experimental evidence and making testable predictions based on a model or simulation is often not considered sufficient.

BD&S moves beyond usual notions of Big Data and treats it as an emerging field of practices that is not defined by but generative of (sometimes) novel data qualities such as high volume and granularity and complex analytics such as data linking and mining. It thus attends to digital content generated through online and offline practices in social, commercial, scientific, and government domains. This includes, for instance, content generated on the Internet through social media and search engines but also that which is generated in closed networks (commercial or government transactions) and open networks such as digital archives, open government and crowdsourced data.

Its focus is social science research on communicating with computer-based media technologies. Within that general purview, the journal is broadly interdisciplinary, publishing work by scholars in communication, business, education, political science, sociology, psychology, media studies, information science, and other disciplines. Acceptable formats for submission include original research articles and meta-analyses of prior research. JCMC is one of the oldest web-based Internet studies journals in existence, having been published quarterly continuously since June 1995. The journal was started by Margaret McLaughlin and Sheizaf Rafaeli in response to the growth of CMC scholarship in the early- to mid-1990s. The founding editors had the vision to make JCMC an open-access, online journal. This, combined with high quality standards, proved to be a recipe for success: today JCMC is widely read and cited by CMC scholars around the world. In 2004, JCMC became an official journal of the International Communication Association.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and CommunicationsWireless network security solutions","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and CommunicationsWireless network security solutions","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18232&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18232\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Though the emphasis is on the macroscopic level of human brain organization, meso-and microscopic neuroimaging across all species will be considered if they provide advances that are of relevance to a systems-level understanding of the human brain. The main criterion on which papers are judged for NeuroImage, is to what extent the scientific contribution helps advance our understanding of brain function, organization, and structure. NeuroImage, also welcomes papers that explicitly address these questions in animal models or clinical populations. Papers that do not contain significant methodological development, and whose major contribution is to use imaging to advance the understanding of pathology, abnormal development, use of biomarkers or other questions of clinical utility should be referred to NeuroImage: Clinical. NeuroImage, publishes original research articles, papers on methods, models of brain function, as well as positions on contentious issues. The journal strives to incorporate theoretical and technological innovations and is committed to publishing the highest quality papers in both print and electronic media. The editors and the editorial board members come from highly diverse specialties, reflecting the fact that imaging neuroscience is a multi-disciplinary science.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17495&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17495\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The main interests of the Journal lie in publishing studies that further our understanding the pathophysiological and pathogenetic mechanisms of human disease. The Journal welcomes investigative studies on human tissues, in vitro and in vivo experimental studies, and investigations based on animal models with a clear relevance to human disease, including transgenic systems. In general, hypothesis driven studies that appropriately employ multiple investigative techniques are preferred over those that rely on a single methodology. As well as original research papers, the Journal seeks to provide rapid publication in a variety of other formats, including editorials, review articles, commentaries and perspectives and other features, both contributed and solicited. Purely descriptive papers on diagnostic pathology (including case reports and prognostic papers without mechanistic and experimental insights) are not considered central to the Journal’s purpose. Correspondence relating to papers published in the Journal will be considered, but only if of general interest. Such correspondance may be published in online versions only, at the Editor's discretion. In determining content, the primary considerations are excellence, relevance and novelty. As the journal of The Pathological Society, it seeks to reflect the broad scientific interests of the Society’s membership but its ethos, authorship, content and purpose are those expected of a leading publication in the international scientific literature.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pathology and Forensic Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15991&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15991\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
