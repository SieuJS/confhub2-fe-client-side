The journal continues to play a key role in advancing human neuroscience in its many forms and methodologies (including central and peripheral measures), covering research on the interrelationships between the physiological and psychological aspects of brain and behavior. Typically, studies published in Psychophysiology include psychological independent variables and noninvasive physiological dependent variables (hemodynamic, optical, and electromagnetic brain imaging and/or peripheral measures such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, electromyography, pupillography, and many others). The majority of studies published in the journal involve human participants, but work using animal models of such phenomena is occasionally published. Psychophysiology welcomes submissions on new theoretical, empirical, and methodological advances in: cognitive, affective, clinical and social neuroscience, psychopathology and psychiatry, health science and behavioral medicine, and biomedical engineering. The journal publishes theoretical papers, evaluative reviews of literature, empirical papers, and methodological papers, with submissions welcome from scientists in any fields mentioned above.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biological

The stresses that challenge man\"s existence in our modern society may result in failure of these coping mechanisms, with resultant stress-induced illness. The aim of the journal therefore is to provide a forum for discussion of all aspects of stress which affect the individual in both health and disease. The Journal explores the subject from as many aspects as possible, so that when stress becomes a consideration, health information can be presented as to the best ways by which to minimise its effects.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied

Categories of publication include research articles, reviews, editorials, commentaries, and correspondence. All material is peer-reviewed. We aim to disseminate knowledge about diabetes research with the goal of improving the management of people with diabetes. The journal therefore seeks to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas between clinicians and researchers worldwide. Topics covered are of importance to all healthcare professionals working with people with diabetes, whether in primary care or specialist services.

It probes the use of computing to improve education and learning in a variety of settings, platforms and environments. The journal aims to provide perspectives at all levels, from the micro level of specific pedagogical approaches in Computing Education and applications or instances of use in classrooms, to macro concerns of national policies and major projects; from pre-school classes to adults in tertiary institutions; from teachers and administrators to researchers and designers; from institutions to online and lifelong learning. The journal is embedded in the research and practice of professionals within the contemporary global context and its breadth and scope encourage debate on fundamental issues at all levels and from different research paradigms and learning theories. The journal does not proselytize on behalf of the technologies (whether they be mobile, desktop, interactive, virtual, games-based or learning management systems) but rather provokes debate on all the complex relationships within and between computing and education, whether they are in informal or formal settings. It probes state of the art technologies in Computing Education and it also considers the design and evaluation of digital educational artefacts.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"E-learning","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library

As the official journal of the European Academy of Management, EMR aims to foster high quality research among European scholars, and academics specifically interested in European management issues with a relevance to the global community. EMR is receptive to research across a broad range of management topics such as human resource management, organization behavior, strategic management, innovation, corporate governance, and managerial economics. Contributions may be grounded in the social science disciplines of economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, history, anthropology, among others; in addition to business and management. Articles can be empirical, theoretical, or measurement oriented. Empirical articles should have well articulated and strong theoretical foundations. Theoretical articles should make a distinctive contribution to theory. All types of empirical methods - quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods - are acceptable. EMR encourages the interplay between theorizing and empirical research in the belief that they should be mutually informative. The journal is especially interested in new data sources, including testing new theory and expanding sample pools via alternative approaches to sampling and measurement, and samples drawn from nontraditional or less common sources and the examination of the validity and reliability of such samples. While aiming to provide a forum for discourse to researchers worldwide, the journal strives to promote a European view in the understanding and betterment of management in different contexts, and the application of scholarly knowledge to real-world management practice.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17700156774&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17700156774\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

PPMG seeks to develop new theories, frameworks, and conceptual models, as well as summative and critical evaluations of existing theoretical frameworks. It welcomes contributions from a variety of epistemological frameworks that can add a new perspective to public administration and governance, e.g. positivist, normative, interpretive, grounded, and critical theory. In addition to publishing new theoretical work, the journal is interested in analytical reviews of literature. While the primary focus of the journal is not to conduct empirical studies, it anticipates treatment of concepts used in empirical work, discussion of trends, advancements, and synthesis of empirical work such as meta-analyses, and theoretical developments that offer empirical illustrations, either quantitative or qualitative.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101068168&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101068168\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Journal publishes high quality, insightful, well-written papers that explore current and new issues in international finance. Papers that foster dialogue, innovation, and intellectual risk-taking in financial studies; as well as shed light on the interaction between finance and broader societal concerns are particularly appreciated. The Journal welcomes submissions that seek to expand the boundaries of academic finance and otherwise challenge the discipline. Papers studying finance using a variety of methodologies; as well as interdisciplinary studies will be considered for publication. Papers that examine topical issues using extensive international data sets are welcome. Single-country studies can also be considered for publication provided that they develop novel methodological and theoretical approaches or fall within the Journal's priority themes. It is especially important that single-country studies communicate to the reader why the particular chosen country is especially relevant to the issue being investigated. [...] The scope of topics that are most interesting to RIBAF readers include the following: -Financial markets and institutions -Financial practices and sustainability -The impact of national culture on finance -The impact of formal and informal institutions on finance -Privatizations, public financing, and nonprofit issues in finance -Interdisciplinary financial studies -Finance and international development -International financial crises and regulation -Financialization studies -International financial integration and architecture -Behavioral aspects in finance -Consumer finance -Methodologies and conceptualization issues related to finance","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12056&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12056\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

However, a combination of ever-growing demands on water resources and low water use efficiency has caused severe water and environmental stresses, increasing the risk of contamination. An interdisciplinary, integrated and balanced approach is required to secure the safety of the water supply and water environmental management systems. The development of a sustainable, multifaceted and multilevel water cycle system is a new and fast-growing focus in the field of water. The water cycle has traditionally referred to the natural circulation system, where water evaporates, condenses and falls to the ground in a continuous cycle. However, attention is shifting to the water meta-cycle, where water has multiple interactions with the environment, ecology, hydrology, hydraulics, civil engineering, meteorology and topography under different scales and dimensions. Understanding this water meta-cycle, the processes involved, and their potential impact is a scientific challenge of enormous importance. Progress is needed to advance our knowledge and to inform sustainable development.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101060459&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101060459\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers that deal with new developments in safety or environmental aspects, demonstrating how research results can be used in process engineering design and practice, are particularly encouraged. Experimental or theoretical research work bringing new perspectives to established principles, highlighting unsolved problems or indicating directions for future research will also be considered. The journal is especially interested in contributions that extend the boundaries of traditional engineering as well as in multidisciplinary papers. Papers related to environmental protection must take an integrated pollution control approach, demonstrating clearly that any proposed treatment method does not simply transfer pollution from one environmental medium to another, for example, from air to water or from water to solid waste. All such papers must discuss how any treatment effluents, spent adsorbents, etc., can be treated or disposed of safely, avoiding transfer of pollution to another environmental medium.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering

It has the main purpose of communicating new research and advances to different actors of society, including researchers, conservationists, practitioners, and policymakers. Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation publishes original papers on biodiversity conservation and restoration, on the main drivers affecting native ecosystems, and on nature’s benefits to people and human wellbeing. This scope includes studies on biodiversity patterns, the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, biological invasion and climate change on biodiversity, conservation genetics, spatial conservation planning, ecosystem management, ecosystem services, sustainability and resilience of socio-ecological systems, conservation policy, among others. There is no bias towards particular biogeographic regions, organisms or ecosystems. Scientific papers must focus on new conceptual or methodological developments with practical implications. Case studies will be considered only if inserted in these more general contexts. Authors are encouraged to submit reviews and essays that provide new perspectives on arising ecological and conservation issues. Purely descriptive papers and studies without a clear link with conservation theory and practice will not be considered. Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation is the official scientific journal of the \"Brazilian Association for Ecological Science and Conservation\". It is an open access journal, supported by the Boticário Group Foundation for Nature Protection, and thus without any charge for authors. Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation was previously published, between 2003 and 2016, as \"Natureza & Conservação\".","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100817643&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100817643\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Recent decades have seen an unprecedented explosion in the human capacity to acquire, store, and manipulate data and information. We are experiencing an historic revolution in knowledge creation, communication, and utilisation. DSJ explores what that means for the conduct of research and data management. We regard data science as the ‘science of data’ — the evidence-based study of the socio-technical developments and transformations that affect science policy; the conduct and methods of research; and the data systems, standards, and infrastructure that are integral to research. A central goal of DSJ is to ensure that data are used in the most effective, efficient, and ethical way in promoting knowledge and learning. It is a peer-reviewed, open-access, electronic journal that is relevant to all sciences as well as the empirical humanities.

In addition, study protocols for controlled trials and cohort studies, with an emphasis on methods for assessing dietary exposures and outcomes as well as intervention components, will be considered. Manuscripts that consider eating patterns holistically, as opposed to solely reductionist approaches that focus on specific dietary components in isolation, are encouraged. Also encouraged are papers that take a holistic or systems perspective in attempting to understand possible compensatory and differential effects of nutrition interventions. The journal does not consider animal studies. In addition to the influence of eating patterns for human health, we also invite research providing insights into the environmental sustainability of dietary practices. Again, a holistic perspective is encouraged, for example, through the consideration of how eating patterns might maximize both human and planetary health.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12653&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12653\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It stimulates the exchange and coupling of traditional scientific knowledge on the environment, with the experiential knowledge among decision makers and other stakeholders and also connects natural sciences and social and behavioral sciences. Environmental Development includes and promotes scientific work from the non-western world, and also strengthens the collaboration between the developed and developing world. Further it links environmental research to broader issues of economic and social-cultural developments, and is intended to shorten the delays between research and publication, while ensuring thorough peer review. Environmental Development also creates a forum for transnational communication, discussion and global action. Environmental Development is open to a broad range of disciplines and authors. The journal welcomes, in particular, contributions from a younger generation of researchers, and papers expanding the frontiers of environmental sciences, pointing at new directions and innovative answers.

International in scope, the journal welcomes theoretically robust, empirically rich research from an array of fields including political ecology, environmental justice, science and technology studies, conservation and the environmental humanities. The journal proposes to push the ways we understand the uneven, dynamic, and often unjust intersections of nature and space with particular interest in their societal, political, and economic dimensions. We accept work from across the social sciences, humanities and critical biophysical approaches, and are especially interested in research that engages feminist, anti-colonial, antiracist, queer, posthumanist, and heterodox and alternative economic approaches. Themes of particular interest include: the relationships between economic and environmental transformation; justice-based environmental movements; environmental governance; resource politics; intersections between social difference and environmental issues; the politics of environmental knowledge; and critical engagement with debates concerning the Anthropocene, 'environmental crises' and global environmental change. While our submissions seek to provide both original conceptual and empirical insights, in some cases we will accept empirically rich articles rooted in particular places and locations.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101093005&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101093005\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Each issue is devoted to a specific topic within this broad spectrum. Announcements of the topical areas planned for future issues, along with deadlines for receipt of manuscripts, are published in this Journal and in the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics. Generally, the scope of manuscripts appropriate to this Journal is the same as that for the IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics. Manuscripts are published that report original theoretical and/or experimental research results that advance the scientific and technological base of quantum electronics devices, systems, or applications. The Journal is dedicated toward publishing research results that advance the state of the art or add to the understanding of the generation, amplification, modulation, detection, waveguiding, or propagation characteristics of coherent electromagnetic radiation having sub-millimeter and shorter wavelengths. In order to be suitable for publication in this Journal, the content of manuscripts concerned with subject-related research must have a potential impact on advancing the technological base of quantum electronic devices, systems, and/or applications.

The journal prioritizes findings that advance the scientific basis of ecology and conservation, promoting the development of remote-sensing based methods relevant to the management of land use and biological systems at all levels, from populations and species to ecosystems and biomes. The journal defines remote sensing in its broadest sense, including data acquisition by hand-held and fixed ground-based sensors, such as camera traps and acoustic recorders, and sensors on airplanes and satellites. The intended journal’s audience includes ecologists, conservation scientists, policy makers, managers of terrestrial and aquatic systems, remote sensing scientists, and students. Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation is a fully open access journal from Wiley and the Zoological Society of London. Remote sensing has enormous potential as to provide information on the state of, and pressures on, biological diversity and ecosystem services, at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This new publication provides a forum for multidisciplinary research in remote sensing science, ecological research and conservation science.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computers in Earth Sciences","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100820782&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100820782\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The interfaces are relevant in many areas such as financial reporting and communication, valuation, financial performance measurement and managerial reward and control structures. A feature of JBFA is that it recognises that informational problems are pervasive in financial markets and business organisations, and that accounting plays an important role in resolving such problems. JBFA welcomes both theoretical and empirical contributions. Nonetheless, theoretical papers should yield novel testable implications, and empirical papers should be theoretically well-motivated. The Editors view accounting and finance as being closely related to economics and, as a consequence, papers submitted will often have theoretical motivations that are grounded in economics. JBFA, however, also seeks papers that complement economics-based theorising with theoretical developments originating in other social science disciplines or traditions. While many papers in JBFA use econometric or related empirical methods, the Editors also welcome contributions that use other empirical research methods. Although the scope of JBFA is broad, it is not a suitable outlet for highly abstract mathematical papers, or empirical papers with inadequate theoretical motivation. Also, papers that study asset pricing, or the operations of financial markets, should have direct implications for one or more of preparers, regulators, users of financial statements, and corporate financial decision makers, or at least should have implications for the development of future research relevant to such users.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business,
