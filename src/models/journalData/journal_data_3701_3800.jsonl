Our aim is to publish innovative pragmatic scholarship from all perspectives, which contributes to theories of how speakers produce and interpret language in different contexts drawing on attested data from a wide range of languages/cultures in different parts of the world. The Journal of Pragmatics also encourages work that uses attested language data to explore the relationship between pragmatics and neighbouring research areas such as semantics, discourse analysis, conversation analysis and ethnomethodology, interactional linguistics, sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, media studies, psychology, sociology, and the philosophy of language. Alongside full-length articles, discussion notes and book reviews, the journal welcomes proposals for high quality special issues in all areas of pragmatics which make a significant contribution to a topical or developing area at the cutting-edge of research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=26803&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=26803\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Its great strength lies in the diversity of disciplines which it encompasses, drawing together results from materials science, physical metallurgy, solid-state chemistry and physics. The interdisciplinary nature of the journal is evident in many subject areas. Experimental and theoretical approaches to materials problems require an active interplay between a variety of traditional and novel scientific disciplines. - The journal will not consider topics on liquid alloys, traditional steel, wear, creep, welding and joining, organic materials and polymers, coordination chemistry, ionic liquids, catalysis and biochemistry; it will not consider papers reporting only syntheses without any properties, purely computational papers without sufficient experimental validation, CALPHAD papers without regard to experimental observations. The submission of papers on technology of materials and processing is not encouraged. First principle calculations can only be accepted, if the system has already been proven in experiment or if this is required for a dedicated application. Technical reports will not be accepted. - The work published in the journal should comprise studies on synthesis and structure combined with investigations of chemical and physical properties of alloys and compounds, contributing to the development of areas of current scientific interest. - Papers submitted for publication should contain new experimental or theoretical results and their interpretation.

It was founded by Howard W. Haggard, M.D., director of Yale University’s Laboratory of Applied Physiology. Dr. Haggard was a physiologist studying the effects of alcohol on the body, and he started the Journal as a way to publish the increasing amount of research on alcohol use, abuse, and treatment that emerged from Yale and other institutions in the years following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. In addition to original research, the Journal also published abstracts summarizing other published documents dealing with alcohol. At Yale, Dr. Haggard built a large team of alcohol researchers within the Laboratory of Applied Physiology—including E.M. Jellinek, who became managing editor of the Journal in 1941. In 1943, to bring together the various alcohol research projects conducted by the Laboratory, Dr. Haggard formed the Section of Studies on Alcohol, which also became home to the Journal and its editorial staff. In 1950, the Section was renamed the Center of Alcohol Studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social

Research in Transportation Business & Management welcomes proposals for themed volumes from scholars in management, in relation to all modes of transport. Issues should be cross-disciplinary for one mode or single-disciplinary for all modes. We are keen to receive proposals that combine and integrate theories and concepts that are taken from or can be traced to origins in different disciplines or lessons learned from different modes and approaches to the topic. By facilitating the development of interdisciplinary or intermodal concepts, theories and ideas, and by synthesizing these for the journal's audience, we seek to contribute to both scholarly advancement of knowledge and the state of managerial practice. Potential volume themes include: -Sustainability and Transportation Management- Transport Management and the Reduction of Transport's Carbon Footprint- Marketing Transport/Branding Transportation- Benchmarking, Performance Measurement and Best Practices in Transport Operations- Franchising, Concessions and Alternate Governance Mechanisms for Transport Organisations- Logistics and the Integration of Transportation into Freight Supply Chains- Risk Management (or Asset Management or Transportation Finance or ...): Lessons from Multiple Modes- Engaging the Stakeholder in Transportation Governance- Reliability in the Freight Sector","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Business and

Since World War II, agricultural production systems and food consumption patterns have undergone astonishing changes. Agricultural research, combined with high input, capital intensive, and trade-based applications, has expanded the productive capacity of the world's farms tremendously. However, serious questions have been raised about the sustainability of industrial agricultural and food systems, about the criteria for judging the risks and benefits of chemical and biological technologies, about food safety, about the poor's entitlement to food in developed and developing countries, and about who will farm in the future and how. The Agriculture, Food, and Human Values Society is an organization of professionals dedicated to an open and free discussion of these and other related issues and to an understanding of the values that shape and the structures that underlie alternative visions of current and future food and agricultural systems. Agriculture and Human Values is the official journal of the Society. Like the Society, it seeks to create educational and scholarly discussions across the humanities, the social sciences, food and nutrition studies, and the agricultural disciplines, and to promote an ethical, social and ecological understanding of agricultural and food systems.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15081&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15081\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The preferred length of manuscripts is 5000 words without counting references or the abstract. Submissions will be provided with a final decision targeted for completion within 4 weeks of either: (a) conditional acceptance with a single minor revision; or (b) rejection. Additive manufacturing technologies are becoming widely adopted in industry and academia as disruptive new end-use products are designed and manufactured. Motivated by the need for a short-format, fast-publication journal, this provides a unique publication outlet for additive manufacturing researchers, engineers and materials scientists in academia and industry. The journal is agnostic to application areas but all work must be related to additive manufacturing as defined by the ISO/ASTM 52900 standards. The journal covers a wide scope, comprising early research on new processes, design paradigms, materials systems, and applications in the field of additive manufacturing.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101162721&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101162721\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Consideration will also be given to reports of work in other fields relevant to the understanding of human pathology as well as manuscripts on the application of new methods and techniques in pathology. Submission of purely experimental articles is discouraged but manuscripts on experimental work applicable to diagnostic pathology are welcomed. Biomarker studies are welcomed but need to abide by strict rules (e.g. REMARK) of adequate sample size and relevant marker choice.

Global in perspective and drawing on both theory and empirical research, the journal reflects the need to engage critically with modern consumer culture and to understand its central role in contemporary social processes. The Journal of Consumer Culture brings together articles from the many social sciences and humanities in which consumer culture has become a significant focus. It also engages with overarching contemporary perspectives on social transformation, all of which give an unprecedented importance to consumption in understanding social processes at both local and global levels. The Journal of Consumer Culture covers a wide range of topics relating consumer culture to issues such as: globalization shopping and marketing the body ecommerce and the information society social divisions of gender, class, sexuality and ethnicity commodification aestheticisation and virtuality science and technology studies environmental critiques popular and material culture identity taste,

The journal offers a venue for high quality research for and from the region in the face of minimal international publication availability for authors concerned with the region. This includes findings highlighting the diversity in psychiatric behaviour, treatment and outcome related to social, ethnic, cultural and economic differences of the region. The journal publishes peer-reviewed articles and reviews, as well as clinically and educationally focused papers on regional best practices.

Deteriorative reactions occur during processing, when polymers are subjected to heat, oxygen and mechanical stress, and during the useful life of the materials when oxygen and sunlight are the most important degradative agencies. In more specialised applications, degradation may be induced by high energy radiation, ozone, atmospheric pollutants, mechanical stress, biological action, hydrolysis and many other influences. The mechanisms of these reactions and stabilisation processes must be understood if the technology and application of polymers are to continue to advance. The reporting of investigations of this kind is therefore a major function of this journal. However there are also new developments in polymer technology in which degradation processes find positive applications. For example, photodegradable plastics are now available, the recycling of polymeric products will become increasingly important, degradation and combustion studies are involved in the definition of the fire hazards which are associated with polymeric materials and the microelectronics industry is vitally dependent upon polymer degradation in the manufacture of its circuitry. Polymer properties may also be improved by processes like curing and grafting, the chemistry of which can be closely related to that which causes physical deterioration in other circumstances.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Condensed Matter Physics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Condensed Matter Physics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Condensed
