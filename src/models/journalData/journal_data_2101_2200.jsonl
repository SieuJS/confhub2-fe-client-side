The Review comes out monthly from November through June and has roughly 2,500 pages per volume. The organization is formally independent of the Harvard Law School. Student editors make all editorial and organizational decisions and, together with a professional business staff of three, carry out day-to-day operations. Aside from serving as an important academic forum for legal scholarship, the Review has two other goals. First, the journal is designed to be an effective research tool for practicing lawyers and students of the law. Second, it provides opportunities for Review members to develop their own editing and writing skills. Accordingly, each issue contains pieces by student editors as well as outside authors. The Review publishes articles by professors, judges, and practitioners and solicits reviews of important recent books from recognized experts. All articles — even those by the most respected authorities — are subjected to a rigorous editorial process designed to sharpen and strengthen substance and tone.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Law","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=14316&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=14316\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We accomplish this aim by appointing international authorities to serve as Section Editors in key subject areas such as the many forms of arthritis, osteoporosis and metabolic bone disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Section Editors, in turn, select topics for which leading experts contribute comprehensive review articles that emphasize new developments and recently published papers of major importance, highlighted by annotated reference lists. An international Editorial Board reviews the annual table of contents, suggests articles of special interest to their country/region, and ensures that topics are current and include emerging research.

The journal’s editorial board and contributors reflect the intellectual interests of a global community of academics and practitioners concerned with addressing and analysing aspects that seek to provide a stronger foundation of knowledge in the field of journalism. Journalism Studies pursues an ambitious agenda which encourages exploration of the widest possible range of media and specialisms associated with journalism. It does so by embracing the interdisciplinary nature of journalism studies, which has marked the field since its start. The journal is global in outlook and encourages submissions from a diverse range of geo-political backgrounds. Journalism Studies is committed to publishing work that meets the highest standards of scholarship. This means that manuscripts should be written for an international readership and substantially contribute to conceptual and theoretical models, adhere to measurement and methodological best practices, or advance our understanding of innovative methods and research issues in the field of journalism.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700187607&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700187607\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We invite manuscripts that investigate learning and its change and growth from various lenses, including psychological, social, cognitive, sociohistorical, and affective. Studies examining the relationship of learning to teaching, the science knowledge and practices, the learners themselves, and the contexts (social, political, physical, ideological, institutional, epistemological, and cultural) are similarly welcome. -Issues and Trends : consisting primarily of analytical, interpretive, or persuasive essays on current educational, social, or philosophical issues and trends relevant to the teaching of science. This special section particularly seeks to promote informed dialogues about current issues in science education, and carefully reasoned papers representing disparate viewpoints are welcomed. Manuscripts submitted for this section may be in the form of a position paper, a polemical piece, or a creative commentary. -Science Learning in Everyday Life : consisting of analytical, interpretative, or philosophical papers regarding learning science outside of the formal classroom. Papers should investigate experiences in settings such as community, home, the Internet, after school settings, museums, and other opportunities that develop science interest, knowledge or practices across the life span.

Specialty Chief Editors Takao K. Hensch and Edward Ruthazer at Harvard University and McGill University respectively, are supported by an outstanding Editorial Board of international experts. This multidisciplinary open-access journal is at the forefront of disseminating and communicating scientific knowledge and impactful discoveries to researchers, academics and the public worldwide. Frontiers in Neural Circuits launched in 2011 with great success and remains a \"central watering hole\" for research in neural circuits, serving the community worldwide to share data, ideas and inspiration. Articles revealing the anatomy, physiology, development or function of any neural circuitry in any species (from sponges to humans) are welcome. Our common thread seeks the computational strategies used by different circuits to link their structure with function (perceptual, motor, or internal), the general rules by which they operate, and how their particular designs lead to the emergence of complex properties and behaviors. Submissions focused on synaptic, cellular and connectivity principles in neural microcircuits using multidisciplinary approaches, especially newer molecular, developmental and genetic tools, are encouraged. Studies with an evolutionary perspective to better understand how circuit design and capabilities evolved to produce progressively more complex properties and behaviors are especially welcome. The journal is further interested in research revealing how plasticity shapes the structural and functional architecture of neural circuits.

JRI offers humanists, social scientists, policy analysts and legal scholars, and natural scientists and engineers an opportunity to articulate, strengthen, and critique the relations among approaches to responsible innovation, thus giving further shape to a newly emerging community of research and practice. These approaches include ethics, technology assessment, governance, sustainability, socio-technical integration, and others. JRI intends responsible innovation to be inclusive of such terms as responsible development and sustainable development, and the journal invites comparisons and contrasts among such concepts. While issues of risk and environmental health and safety are relevant, JRI especially encourages attention to the assessment of the broader and more subtle human and social dimensions of innovation—including moral, cultural, political, and religious dimensions, social risk, and sustainability addressed in a systemic fashion.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100856611&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100856611\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Many factors, including cost and weight economy, new materials and processes and the growth of powerful methods of analysis have contributed to this growth, and led to the need for a journal which concentrates specifically on structures in which problems arise due to the thinness of the walls. This field includes cold– formed sections, plate and shell structures, reinforced plastics structures and aluminium structures, and is of importance in many branches of engineering. The primary criterion for consideration of papers in Thin–Walled Structures is that they must be concerned with thin–walled structures or the basic problems inherent in thin–walled structures. Provided this criterion is satisfied no restriction is placed on the type of construction, material or field of application. Papers on theory, experiment, design, etc., are published and it is expected that many papers will contain aspects of all three.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Building and

The journal publishes papers devoted to the exploration of the cellular and molecular biology of granulocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, lymphocytes, NK cells, and other cells involved in host physiology and defense/resistance against disease. Since all cells in the body can directly or indirectly contribute to the maintenance of the integrity of the organism and restoration of homeostasis through repair, JLB also considers articles involving epithelial, endothelial, fibroblastic, neural, and other somatic cell types participating in host defense. Studies covering pathophysiology, cell development, differentiation and trafficking; fundamental, translational and clinical immunology, inflammation, extracellular mediators and effector molecules; receptors, signal transduction and genes are considered relevant. Research articles and reviews that provide a novel understanding in any of these fields are given priority as well as technical advances related to leukocyte research methods.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29607&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29607\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of Current Protocols is to provide the clearest, most detailed, and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given scientific subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols are formatted to include all of the information necessary to perform an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, materials lists with sourcing information, detailed step-by-step instructions with helpful annotations, recipes for reagents and solutions, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article provides invaluable discussions of data analysis and interpretation, background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Current Protocols also publishes overviews which provide theory, strategic planning, and practical advice on particular laboratory methodologies. Current Protocols content is thoughtfully curated for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Monthly issues allow Current Protocols to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments.

Although the principal focus is economic policy issues, when necessary and relevant, international relations papers will also be included.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17600155050&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17600155050\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Yet all too often, nuances that are responsible for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature, but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, materials lists with supplier information, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, recipes for reagents and solutions, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols in Stem Cell Biology to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12300154703&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12300154703\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
