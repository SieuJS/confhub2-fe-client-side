The policy sciences can be applied to articles with greater or lesser intensity to accommodate the focus of an author’s work. At the minimum, this means taking a problem oriented, multi-method or contextual approach. At the fullest expression, it may mean leveraging central theory or explicitly applying aspects of the framework, which is comprised of three principal dimensions: (1) social process, which is mapped in terms of participants, perspectives, situations, base values, strategies, outcomes and effects, with values (power, wealth, enlightenment, skill, rectitude, respect, well-being, and affection) being the key elements in understanding participants’ behaviors and interactions; (2) decision process, which is mapped in terms of seven functions—intelligence, promotion, prescription, invocation, application, termination, and appraisal; and (3) problem orientation, which comprises the intellectual tasks of clarifying goals, describing trends, analyzing conditions, projecting developments, and inventing, evaluating, and selecting alternatives.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management,

The journal focuses on seminal empirical contributions. The journal occasionally publishes exceptionally strong scholarly reviews and theoretical or methodological articles. Studies of any aspect of psychological development are appropriate, as are studies of the biological, social, and cultural factors that affect development. The journal welcomes not only laboratory-based experimental studies but studies employing other rigorous methodologies, such as ethnographies, field research, and secondary analyses of large data sets. We especially seek submissions in new areas of inquiry and submissions that will address contradictory findings or controversies in the field as well as the generalizability of extant findings in new populations. Although most articles in this journal address human development, studies of other species are appropriate if they have important implications for human development. Submissions can consist of single manuscripts, proposed sections, or short reports.

The scope is broad, from fundamental concepts in mechanics to the analysis of novel phenomena and applications. Solids are interpreted broadly to include both hard and soft materials as well as natural and synthetic structures. The approach can be theoretical, experimental or computational.This research activity sits within engineering science and the allied areas of applied mathematics, materials science, bio-mechanics, applied physics, and geophysics. The Journal was founded in 1952 by Rodney Hill, who was its Editor-in-Chief until 1968. The topics of interest to the Journal evolve with developments in the subject but its basic ethos remains the same: to publish research of the highest quality relating to the mechanics of solids. Thus, emphasis is placed on the development of fundamental concepts of mechanics and novel applications of these concepts based on theoretical, experimental or computational approaches, drawing upon the various branches of engineering science and the allied areas within applied mathematics, materials science, structural engineering, applied physics, and geophysics. The main purpose of the Journal is to foster scientific understanding of the processes of deformation and mechanical failure of all solid materials, both technological and natural, and the connections between these processes and their underlying physical mechanisms. In this sense, the content of the Journal should reflect the current state of the discipline in analysis, experimental observation, and numerical simulation. In the interest of achieving this goal, authors are encouraged to consider the significance of their contributions for the field of mechanics and the implications of their results, in addition to describing the details of their work.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Condensed Matter Physics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Condensed Matter

Its main focus is on urbanisation in its broadest sense in the developing world. However, increasingly the interrelationships and linkages between cities and towns in the developing and developed worlds are becoming apparent and solutions to the problems that result are urgently required. The economic, social, technological and political systems of the world are intertwined and changes in one region almost always affect other regions. Habitat International welcomes reports of research on urban issues such as policy and implementation, the links between planning, building and land, finance and management, urban design, the interaction between the natural environment and urban areas the provision of urban services and other related problems. Papers on topics which clearly have broad implications and interrelationships based on the experiences of the developing or developed world will be considered. Submissions exploring these issues within the development context are particularly welcomed. Quality papers, short communications, comments on published papers and reports on relevant conferences from all parts of the world are presented as it is recognised that such urban problems arise everywhere. Hopefully, Habitat International will contribute to their solution.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=13760&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=13760\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It welcomes multidisciplinary articles that bridge agronomy, cropping and farming system research with ecological, genetic, environmental, economical and social sciences. Systemic approaches at the livestock, field, farm, landscape, food systems and global scales, and participatory research are encouraged. ASD does not publish: · monodisciplinary articles in ecology, plant physiology, soil and environmental sciences, genetics, microbiology and entomology that do not explicitly consider crop production. · monodisciplinary articles in economics and social sciences. · studies that involve experiments mainly conducted in pots or disconnected from production conditions. ASD publishes original articles, meta-analyses and review articles. Original articles should demonstrate a clear scientific breakthrough versus current knowledge. Contributions may be on either methodological approaches or approaches addressing major issues in the scope of the journal. Review articles report a critical evaluation of emerging topics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=145746&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=145746\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This means that a wide variety of businesses and operations management problems under the sustainability and climate change domain are in general covered by this journal. Concerns such as energy and water usage efficiency in production, recycling and remanufacturing planning, reducing carbon emissions in operations, managing scarcity of raw materials, waste management, managing sustainable supply chains, disaster management, and emerging problems such as migration crisis are emblematic of the new complex issues facing production and operations managers globally. The journal incentivizes outstanding theoretical and practical developments that study, revise, revisit and enhance traditional strategic, tactical and operational decision problems to generate a new and extended body of knowledge able to tackle sustainable organizational needs and mitigate climate change impacts. Traditional operational and production activities including job scheduling, vehicle routing, facility location, supply chain design, warehouse management, inventory management, capacity expansion and production planning problems, are some of the classical operational management/management science problems where mathematical models and computerized solution methods have to integrate all three sustainable perspectives that require rethought in the sustainability concepts.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101107945&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101107945\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Fundamental articles may address the general principles of chemical measurement science and need not directly address existing or potential analytical methodology. Articles may be entirely theoretical with regard to analysis, or they may report experimental results. They may contribute to any phase of analytical operations, including sampling, bioanalysis, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, microscale and nanoscale systems and structures, environmental analysis, separations, spectroscopy, chemical reactions and selectivity, instrumentation, imaging, surface analysis, and data processing. Papers dealing with known analytical methods should offer a significant, original application of the method, a noteworthy improvement, or results on an important analyte. Research manuscripts include Letters, Technical Notes and Articles. Note that the maximum lengths of Letters, Technical Notes and articles are four, five and eight journal pages, respectively. In addition, the journal publishes Features and Perspectives. Feature articles are written for the generalist and are intended to broaden readers’ professional interests and keep them aware of the role of analytical chemistry in the scientific arena. Perspectives point out the authors’ vision of the character and importance of a new direction in analytical chemistry, analyze research reports that provide the foundation for the new direction, and discuss the nature of the opportunities perceived.

In Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry, we help the reader by providing in a systematic manner: 1.The views of experts on current advances in Green and Sustainable Chemistry in a clear and readable form. 2.Evaluations of the most interesting papers, annotated by experts, from the great wealth of original publications. Division of the subject into sections: The subject Green and Sustainable Chemistry includes all chemical aspects along the life cycle of chemicals as well chemical products and materials e.g. resources, synthesis, use and after life issues. It aims on better understanding where and how chemistry itself can be made more sustainable and whereby chemistry can contribute to sustainability in general. Therefore, the journal it is divided into themed sections, each of which is reviewed once a year. The amount of space devoted to each section is related to its importance: -Mineral and fossil resources and metals- Biomass, bio-fuels and bioenergies- CO2 capture, and chemistry- Green solvents- Green catalysis- New synthetic methods- Photocatalysis- Green processes and technologies- Renewable energy and storage- Sustainable recycling of molecules, materials and products- Benign by Design- New business models, ethics, legislation and economics.

Offering open access publishing, rigorous double-blind peer review, and quick turnaround times for authors, the journal aims to facilitate the replicability of experimental findings through modern open science requirements such as sharing of raw data and detailed methods. Sponsored by the Society for the Neurobiology of Language, the journal invites innovative work that significantly advances the understanding of language mechanisms as implemented in the human brain. Topics of interest include the biological foundations of perceptual, cognitive, motor, and linguistic processes used to produce and understand language in children and adults, and in healthy individuals and those with brain disorders. Work on the evolutionary basis of the brain mechanisms of language in other animals, and in neural computation, are also germane. The editors welcome articles drawing on a range of methods including, but not limited to, behavioral paradigms, functional and structural neuroanatomy, genetics, extracranial and intracranial brain stimulation and recording, and brain-computer interfaces. They also encourage submissions in the form of novel experimental studies, clinical and nonclinical trials, replication studies, computational and theoretical models, and review articles.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101071061&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101071061\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It welcomes, and hopes to foster, work cutting across a variety of disciplinary concerns, among them philosophy, sociology, history, economics and political science. The journal encourages new approaches, including (but not limited to): feminism; environmentalism; critical theory, post-modernism and analytical Marxism; social and public choice theory; law and economics, critical legal studies and critical race studies; and game theoretic, socio-biological and anthropological approaches to politics. It also welcomes work in the history of political thought which builds to a larger philosophical point and work in the philosophy of the social sciences and applied ethics with broader political implications. Featuring a distinguished editorial board from major centres of thought from around the globe, the journal draws equally upon the work of non-philosophers and philosophers and provides a forum of debate between disparate factions who usually keep to their own separate journals.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=24829&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=24829\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal invites scholarship within this broad thematic that fits with one or more of the following four focal areas: 1) Studies of the relationship between the production and use of knowledge in decision making; 2) Studies of the relation between science and other forms of environmental knowledge, including practical, local and indigenous knowledge; 3) Analyses of decision making practices in government, civil society, and businesses and the ways that they engage environmental knowledge; or 4) Studies that present actionable environmental research with a clear description of how it responds to specific policy directives and the pathways by which this research is informing (or could inform) decision-making. Research can address a wide number of environmental issues, such as climate change, food systems, biodiversity loss, human and ecological well-being, resource use- and extraction, land use change, and sustainability more generally. The journal aspires to achieve an appropriate balance between perspectives from the global North as well as the global South and welcomes discussions of (environmental) justice, equity and inclusion. The journal is particularly interested in cutting edge developments in inter- and transdisciplinary work on co-production; arts-based research; integrated nexus and landscape approaches; the trade-offs and synergies between environmental issues and policies; innovations in integrated assessment, monitoring and evaluation; and transitions and transformative change.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21536&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21536\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Chronic Stress focuses on the neurobiology, prevention, assessment, and treatment of the behavioral and biological effect of stress. Progress in the field of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience has been hampered by the lack of replicable biosignatures of diagnosis, biomarkers of treatment response, and biological surrogate treatment endpoints. This is especially affected by the fact that psychiatric diagnoses are heterogeneous syndromes and difficult to model preclinically. Conversely, prolonged stress has long been studied preclinically and is a major component of most psychiatric disorders, with a constellation of clinical biological abnormalities that appear to be disease non-specific and primarily related to the negative effects of prolonged stress (e.g. gray matter abnormalities). Chronic Stress highlights translational and clinical reports focusing on biomarkers and treatment of prolonged stress, regardless of the psychiatric diagnosis. Chronic Stress was created to publish research intended to advance our understanding of the nature and mechanisms of stress, as well as, to contribute to the identification of the biological, behavioral, and social interventions to prevent, assess, and treat the negative effects of stress and to foster and build resilience. It aims to be a leading resource for by scientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, occupational researchers, and physicians of all medical specialties. Types of papers currently being accepted for peer-review include original research papers, brief reports, research reviews, auto-commentary, correspondence, and commentary.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100977385&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100977385\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

All content dealing with understanding the provision of care—the mechanics of practice, care delivery, quality improvement, value, and equity—is the purview of JCO OP. JCO OP also addresses an expressed need by practicing physicians to have compressed, expert opinion addressing common clinical problems with perspectives by disease experts. JCO OP is a monthly journal, with a total of 12 issues per year. The Journal's ISSNs are 2688-1535 (online, version of record) and 2688-1527 (print) JCO OP's content focuses on care delivery from various perspectives, including quality and value of care, improvement science, health services research, business and socioeconomics, performance of clinical trials, professionalism and ethics, and health policy. JCO OP's audience and contributors include all those involved in oncology care delivery, such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, practice managers, business researchers, policy experts, and payers. Contributions address all settings of oncology care, including institutional, academic, and private practice. JCO OP strives to advance our profession's scientific tradition with new evidence to guide practice, since the details of delivery of care are critical to its quality. While the Journal often focuses on policy and delivery issues in the United States these topics know no geographical or philosophical borders, and all countries/health systems have insights to contribute.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology (nursing)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology (nursing)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology (nursing)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology (nursing)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100981740&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100981740\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It features contributions that have policy relevance, both theoretical and applied. EAP particularly seeks to publish passionate, critical, and controversial articles. It is open for orthodox but also unorthodox approaches. The journal has three main sections. They are: Policy Debates and Controversies This section will contain highly policy relevant articles that are of general interest to economists. We will strive to obtain opposing views on current topics. Recent Trends in Economic Research This section will contain research articles from all fields of economics, similar to those published in other general interest economics journals, such as the American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics, the Economic Journal, or the Economic Record. These articles will not necessarily be easily accessible to non-academic economists. We expect authors to provide the main insights in a non-technical introduction and in the conclusions. Comments and Discussions of Past and Present Contributions to Economics This section has two aims. On the one hand it is a platform to critically discuss recent contributions to the economic literature. This section will contain contributions that revalidate econometric articles and/or discuss the importance of recent findings in economics. On the other hand, it will contain a critical appreciation of classic contributions to the economic literature. We will invite original authors as well as scholars that work in the field to review the importance of classic contributions to modern economics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5800191435&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5800191435\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Language studies overlaps fields of applied linguistics, language policy, language planning, modern languages and literatures, education, anthropology, sociology, history, political science, psychology, and cultural studies (including related fields, such as law, media, and information technology). CILS focuses on critical discourse and research in language matters, broadly conceived, that is generated from qualitative, critical pedagogical, and emergent paradigms. In these paradigms, language is considered to be a socially constituted cultural construct that gives shape to, and at the same time is shaped by, the larger social, political, and historical contexts of its use. The primary purpose of the journal is to provide a forum for discussion of the research from such emerging paradigms and at the same time to bridge arbitrary disciplinary territories in which it is being done.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12100156088&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12100156088\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
