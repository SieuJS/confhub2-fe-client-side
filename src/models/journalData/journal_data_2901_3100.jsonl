The purpose of TJM is the advancement of mathematics. Editors evaluate submitted papers strictly on the basis of scientific merit. All articles submitted to this journal are peer-reviewed. TJM uses a single-blind peer-review process, which means that the reviewers know who the authors of the manuscript are, but the authors do not know who the peer reviewers are. The African continent is increasingly interested in scientific development, particularly in mathematics. The Tunisian Mathematical Society was founded in 1992 and is a permanent institutional member of the International Mathematical Union. It plays a major role in stimulating and sustaining high-level mathematical research in Tunisia and its surrounding region. With the launch of this journal, the Tunisian Mathematical Society contributes to the development in Africa of scientific research meeting high international standards.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101040699&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101040699\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The range of appropriate contributions is wide, and includes papers on establishing appropriate mathematical models and their numerical solution in all areas of mechanics. The journal also includes articles that present a substantial review of a field in the topics of the journal. With the modern use of computers and numerical methods to model and solve problems, the traditional boundaries between the fields of solid/structural mechanics and fluid mechanics hardly exist any longer, and multiphysics problems are solved that involve all aspects of mechanics. The word 'structures' must therefore now be interpreted in a broad sense including solids, fluids and multiphysics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Civil and Structural

Articles may address multi-level policy making in the European Union and elsewhere; provide cross-national comparative studies; and include comparisons with areas outside Europe. They may deal with a wide range of social policy issues, including: active and passive labour market policies, ageing, education and training, Europeanisation, family policies, gender, health and social care services, migration, pensions and social security, poverty and social exclusion, and privatisation.

Articles deal with the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases in the outpatient as well as in the inpatient setting. Public health issues of local, regional or international importance related to infectious diseases are featured, as well as progress and problems in hospital epidemiology. The main contents of the journal include original articles describing results of research projects, brief reports on new observations that enhance the knowledge of clinicians, and state-of-the-art reviews on topics that are relevant to physicians diagnosing or treating infectious diseases. Case reports describing new infectious etiologies or clinical manifestations are also welcome. Finally, the correspondence section is open to readers who want to respond to articles published in Infection or to succinctly present information to the general readership. Because infectious diseases often present with characteristic clinical pictures that can be seen upon inspection and because imaging and microscopy are an essential part of infection diagnosis, the “Images” section of Infection was created to focus on high-quality pictures with short texts in abstract form.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Infectious

Addressing global concerns and communicating them to the international research community and restoration practitioners, the journal is at the forefront of a vital new direction in science, ecology, and policy. Original papers describe experimental, observational, and theoretical studies on terrestrial, marine, and freshwater systems, and are considered without taxonomic bias. Contributions span the natural sciences, including ecological and biological aspects, as well as the restoration of soil, air and water when set in an ecological context; and the social sciences, including cultural, philosophical, political, educational, economic and historical aspects. Edited by a distinguished panel, the journal continues to be a major conduit for researchers to publish their findings in the fight to not only halt ecological damage, but also to ultimately reverse it.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology,

We are primarily interested in studies directly pertinent to humans, but submission of robust in vitro and animal work is also encouraged. Interdisciplinary work and research using innovative methods and combinations of laboratory, clinical, and epidemiological methodologies and techniques is of great interest to the journal. Several categories of manuscripts (for detailed description see below) are considered: editorials, original articles (also including randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses),

We accomplish this aim by appointing international experts in major subject areas across the discipline to review select topics emphasizing recent developments and highlighting important new papers and emerging concepts. We also provide commentaries from well-known figures in the field, and an Editorial Board of internationally diverse members suggests topics of special interest to their country/region and ensures that topics are current and include emerging research. Over a one- to two-year period, readers are updated on all the major advances in allergy and asthma.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=20753&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=20753\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Further, while SJPH particularly focuses on the Nordic regions, we will increasingly publish research from other European and non-European countries, which also should be of interest and relevance to our Nordic audience. We encourage contributors to take an interdisciplinary approach involving, for example, sociology, psychology, technology, social medicine, epidemiology, public health and preventive medicine, but also an inter-sectoral approach, including of course academia, but also people working in governments, NGOs, think-tanks, the UN and in health care. The unequal distribution of health and its determinants (both within and outside the health care system) taps into many other areas of public health, which will allow for a large variety of research topics, however SJPH will focus particularly on (in alphabetical order): • Ageing and health • Global health/child health • Mental health • Migration/ethnicity/refugee health • Occupational health However, when the editorial board first came together, we also agreed upon a wider research agenda which is not restricted to these areas. We are interested in publishing work that focuses on a broad range of health outcomes, including mortality, self-reported health, mental health, cardiovascular health, cancer, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and disability/functional limitations. We are interested in determinants, including but not limited to housing and living conditions, occupational health, including working conditions, lifestyle, stigma, childhood conditions, social capital and institutional arrangements (such as the welfare state).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18842&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18842\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It is a midwifery journal that publishes on all matters that affect women and birth, from pre-conceptual counselling, through pregnancy, birth, and the first six weeks postnatal. All papers accepted will draw from and contribute to the relevant contemporary research, policy and/or theoretical literature. We seek research papers, quality assurances papers (with ethical approval) discussion papers, clinical practice papers, case studies and original literature reviews. Our women-centred focus is inclusive of the family, fetus and newborn, both well and sick, and covers both healthy and complex pregnancies and births. The journal seeks papers that take a woman-centred focus on maternity services, epidemiology, primary health care, reproductive psycho/physiology, midwifery practice, theory, research, education, management and leadership. We also seek relevant papers on maternal mental health and neonatal well-being, natural and complementary therapies, local, national and international policy, management, politics, economics and societal and cultural issues as they affect childbearing women and their families. Topics may include, where appropriate, neonatal care, child and family health, women’s health, related to pregnancy, birth and the postpartum, including lactation. Interprofessional papers relevant to midwifery are welcome. Articles are double blind peer-reviewed, primarily by experts in the field of the submitted work.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4700152255&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=4700152255\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

ET&C seeks to publish papers describing original experimental or theoretical work that significantly advances understanding in the area of environmental toxicology, environmental chemistry and hazard/risk assessment. Emphasis is given to papers that enhance capabilities for the prediction, measurement, and assessment of the fate and effects of chemicals in the environment, rather than simply providing additional data. The scientific impact of papers is judged in terms of the breadth and depth of the findings and the expected influence on existing or future scientific practice. Methodological papers must make clear not only how the work differs from existing practice, but the significance of these differences to the field. Site-based research or monitoring must have regional or global implications beyond the particular site, such as evaluating processes, mechanisms, or theory under a natural environmental setting.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Chemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=25094&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=25094\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Prospects aims to influence a wide range of actors in the field of education and development, whether academics, policy-makers, curriculum-developers, assessors, teachers or students. Unlike other journals in the field, which deal only with theoretical or research-related aspects, Prospects also focuses on policy implementation and aims at improving the extent and effectiveness of communication between theorists and researchers, on one side, and policy makers and practitioners, on the other. The journal thus welcomes innovative empirical research, case studies of policy and practice, conceptual analyses and policy evaluations, as well as critical analyses of published research and existing policy.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=24236&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=24236\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Communication Monographs publishes original scholarship that contributes to the understanding of human communication. Articles in Communication Monographs should endeavor to ask questions about the diverse and complex issues that interest communication scholars. The journal especially welcomes questions that bridge boundaries traditionally separating scholars within the communication discipline and that address issues of clear theoretical, conceptual, methodological, and/or social importance. Diverse approaches to addressing and answering these questions, including theoretical argument, quantitative and qualitative empirical research, and rhetorical and textual analysis, as well as acknowledgement of the often tentative and partial nature of any answers, are welcomed. Approaches to answering questions should be clearly relevant to the questions asked, rigorous in terms of both argument and method, cognizant of alternative interpretations, and contextualized within the wider body of communication scholarship. In considering the questions and answers posed in submissions to Communication Monographs , a premium will be placed on cogent arguments and on writing that is clear and understandable to readers across the various areas of Communication research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12853&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12853\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It ranges from the microarchitecture level via the system software level up to the application-specific architecture level. Aspects such as real-time systems, operating systems, FPGA programming, programming languages, communications (limited to analysis and the software stack), mobile systems, parallel and distributed architectures as well as additional subjects in the computer and system architecture area will fall within the scope of this journal. Technology will not be a main focus, but its use and relevance to particular designs will be. Case studies are welcome but must contribute more than just a design for a particular piece of software. Design automation of such systems including methodologies, techniques and tools for their design as well as novel designs of software components fall within the scope of this journal. Novel applications that use embedded systems are also central in this journal. While hardware is not a part of this journal hardware/software co-design methods that consider interplay between software and hardware components with and emphasis on software are also relevant here.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Hardware and Architecture","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12398&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12398\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It is published quarterly, in January, April, July and October, by Elsevier. The Journal focuses on the rapidly growing field of orthopaedic translational research. While there are a number of high quality orthopaedic journals, none are solely dedicated to the field of orthopaedic translational research. The importance of translational research is quickly being recognized by all spectrums of the scientific community, from clinicians to basic science researchers. To truly improve the health of people, scientific research on the cellular and molecular level must be utilized and applied appropriately in the clinical setting. A journal that is purely dedicated to the art of translational research is a monumental step in the advancement of musculoskeletal care by bringing cutting edge knowledge to the forefront and allowing pioneers of orthopaedic translation to exchange and mutually enhance expertise. JOT aims to be that linking factor and welcomes high quality manuscripts that will advance the field of orthopaedic translation. JOT is devoted to research and issues of strong interest in translational medicine on musculoskeletal and related themes.

The journal publishes research that generates knowledge about human development that informs public dialogue, social policy, and preventive and development optimizing interventions. The applied developmental science orientation is defined by three conjoint emphases. The applied aspect reflects its direct implication for what individuals, families, practitioners, and policymakers do. The developmental aspect emphasizes a focus on systematic and successive changes within individual and social systems that occur across the life span. The science aspect underscores the need to use a range of research methods to collect reliable and objective information in a systematic manner to test the validity of theory and application. The convergence of these three aspects leads to a fostering of a reciprocal relationship between theory and application as a cornerstone of applied developmental science, one wherein empirically based, developmental theory not only guides intervention strategies and social policy, but is influenced by the outcome of these activities. Furthermore, the convergence calls for a multidisciplinary perspective aimed at integrating information from biological, medical, social, and behavioral science disciplines.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5700155900&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5700155900\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

There is currently intense interest in the genetics of cerebellar ataxias and in the roles of the cerebellum in motor control and cognitive functioning. This region contains more neurons than all the other structures of the brain. As a result of the ageing population, diseases associated with cerebellar dysfunction are becoming more widespread. Despite the vast amount of scientific research in this area, no journal exists that is devoted specifically to the cerebellum. The growing number of researchers in this field currently have to find information in a wide range of publications. The Cerebellum will cover all the latest developments in this field to ensure readers are kept fully up to date from one source. The unique Editorial Board comprising internationally-renowned experts aims to create an authoritative journal that will be a significant and original addition to the neuroscience literature. The Cerebellum will be of immense interest to researchers including: neuroscientists in molecular and cellular biology; neurophysiologists; researchers in neurotransmission; neurologists; geneticians; radiologists; paediatricians; anatomists; neuropsychologists; trainees in neurology and psychiatry.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=14853&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=14853\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

As such, the journal is interested in laboratory and animal studies reporting on novel biomarkers of tumor progression and response to therapy and on their applicability to human cancers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29094&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29094\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal emphasizes the understanding of mechanism that is relevant to all aspects of human disease and translation to patients. All articles are rigorously reviewed. The Journal favors publication of full-length papers where modern scientific technologies are used to explain molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms. Articles that merely report observations are rarely accepted. Recommendations from the Declaration of Helsinki or NIH guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals must be adhered to. Articles should be written at a level accessible to readers who are non-specialists in the topic of the article themselves, but who are interested in the research. The Journal welcomes reviews on topics of wide interest to investigators in the life sciences. We particularly encourage submission of brief, focused reviews containing high-quality artwork and require the use of mechanistic summary diagrams.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry,

The journal covers a broad spectrum of preeminent practices and best available data to the top interventional and translational research, and innovative developments in the field of infection control. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control believes that future solutions require a better understanding of the factors contributing to the development and spread of multi-drug resistance pathogens, possibilities to prevent transmission and infection, and insight into the difference between developed countries and countries with limited resources. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control needs to combine best practices, experience and latest research results from around the globe to overcome the challenge posed by healthcare-associated infections. ARIC welcomes all manuscripts related to the field of HAI prevention and infection control. Some examples are listed below: Prevention of health-care associated infection in hospitals. Infection control and antimicrobial-resistance in high-risk settings (e.g. ICUs). HAI prevention and antimicrobial-resistance in special settings e.g. long-term care facilities. Infection control and antimicrobial-resistance in community settings.

Opinions expressed in the journal are the sole responsibility of the authors and publication does not imply the editors' agreement. Manuscripts describing molecular-genetic and/or gene expression data that are not integrated with biochemical analysis and/or actual measurements of plant physiological processes are not suitable for PPB. Also \"Omics\" studies (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) reporting descriptive analysis without an element of functional validation assays, will not be considered. Similarly, applied agronomic or phytochemical studies that generate no new, fundamental insights in plant physiological and/or biochemical processes are not suitable for publication in PPB. Plant Physiology and Biochemistry publishes several types of articles: Reviews, Papers and Short Papers. Articles for Reviews are either invited by the editor or proposed by the authors for the editor's prior agreement. Reviews should not exceed 40 typewritten pages and Short Papers no more than approximately 8 typewritten pages. The fundamental character of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry remains that of a journal for original results.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16617&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16617\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is intended as a medium for the communication of results and developments in the field of Radiology, particularly on advances in diagnostic imaging and its allied sciences. The journal welcomes original contributions on both basic and clinical aspects of modern radiology and therapy, including diagnostic radiology and interventional techniques, with special emphasis on modern imaging techniques, radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, radiobiology and health physics. A distinguished Editorial Board and a selection of reports published in the form of original articles, review articles, editorials, short communications and letters to the editor render this publication indispensable for radiologists and related specialists. As of 2014 the journal is published monthly, online only and in English language. The Journal aims at being a forum for the international radiological community, therefore contributions coming from authors working in countries other than Italy are welcome. The journal visibility in the scientific community is further enhanced by its online edition, available at www.springerlink.com.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17858&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17858\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This journal is interested in any trophic transfer step that leads to human contaminant exposure, such as residue levels in matrices that humans are exposed to, through to direct measurements of human exposure(s) through contaminant residue or biomarkers in human tissues (i.e. tissues and bloods), and subsequent links to health. The journal will provide a unique platform for scientists in this field to exchange ideas and share information on research for the solution of health effects of exposure to pollutants. The journal publishes original research articles and integrative reviews that are relevant to this theme. The subject areas and scientific fields that are included to the journal are as follows: Analytical and detection technologies and approaches in contaminant and biomarker analysis, Mitigation technologies, Biogeochemical sciences, Health sciences, Exposure analysis and Epidemiology, Social sciences and public policy, Mathematical, numerical and statistical methods, Experimental, data collection and data analysis methods.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100464956&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100464956\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

A xenobiotic (“stranger to life”) is defined as a chemical that is not usually found at significant concentrations or expected to reside for long periods in organisms. In addition to man-made chemicals, natural products could also be of interest if they have potent biological properties, special medicinal properties or that a given organism is at risk of exposure in the environment. Topics dealing with abiotic- and biotic-based transformations in various media (xenobiochemistry) and environmental toxicology are also of interest. Areas of interests include the identification of key physical and chemical properties of molecules that predict biological effects and persistence in the environment; the molecular mode of action of xenobiotics; biochemical and physiological interactions leading to change in organism health; pathophysiological interactions of natural and synthetic chemicals; development of biochemical indicators including new “-omics” approaches to identify biomarkers of exposure or effects for xenobiotics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Toxicology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Toxicology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Toxicology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Toxicology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100853985&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100853985\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It publishes research articles, review articles and book/materials reviews. It draws on a range of disciplines that share a focus on exploring new approaches to language learning and teaching from a learner-centred perspective. Changes in learners’ work, life, and study patterns and the use of new technologies for learning strongly impact on every aspect of language learning and teaching, from how we perceive the roles of teachers and learners, to how we adapt to new roles, from the materials and methods we develop to support learners in more flexible ways, to the research methodologies we use to investigate these ways. The impact of globalisation, increased international mobility, and a need for more flexible ways of learning make a critical reflection on the changing needs of the learner necessary. The journal offers a forum for this kind of reflection and encourages researchers to explore the theoretical underpinnings of new pedagogies which focus on the development of and support for innovation in language learning.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=14000156188&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=14000156188\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

By providing scalable, secure, high-performance mechanisms for discovering and negotiating access to remote resources, Grid technologies promise to make it possible for scientific collaborations to share resources on an unprecedented scale, and for geographically distributed groups to work together in ways that were previously impossible. Similar technologies are being adopted within industry, where they serve as important building blocks for emerging service provider infrastructures. Even though the advantages of this technology for classes of applications have been acknowledged, research in a variety of disciplines, including not only multiple domains of computer science (networking, middleware, programming, algorithms) but also application disciplines themselves, as well as such areas as sociology and economics, is needed to broaden the applicability and scope of the current body of knowledge.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and

For instance, new concepts have been effectively applied to characterize creep damage, low and high cycle fatigue damage, creep-fatigue interaction, brittle/elastics damage, ductile plastic damage, strain softening, strain-rate-sensitivity damage, impact damage, and other physical phenomena. Materials investigated include, but are not limited to, polymers, ceramics, metals, composites, biomaterials, electronic packaging, geomaterials, and civil infrastructure materials, etc. The International Journal of Damage Mechanics provides an effective mechanism to accelerate dissemination of knowledge on damage mechanics not only within the research community but also between research laboratories and industrial design departments. The journal promotes and contributes to the development of the concept of damage mechanics bridging the gap between the fields of continuum inelastic deformations and classical fracture mechanics with growing macroscopic cracks.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computational Mechanics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computational
