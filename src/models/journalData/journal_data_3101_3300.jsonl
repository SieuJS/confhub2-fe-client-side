These include the initial preparation of professionals insofar as it affects induction; mentoring and coaching; models of and approaches to professional learning; the management and leadership of professional learning and development and its evaluation; the analysis of local, regional and national policies relating to PLD; and the work of higher education, independent agencies and training and development organisations in supporting and promoting the continuing development of professionals. Contributions will include scholarly discussion of new issues, critical consideration of research in areas relating to PLD, analysis and discussion of new approaches to PLD and conceptual contributions enhancing the debate on the nature and practice of professional learning and development. Although the main focus of articles in the journal is likely to be teacher education, we welcome contributions which discuss the policy and practice of PLD in other professions where the focus of the article is professional learning.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700182114&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700182114\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, materials lists with supplier information, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, recipes for reagents and solutions, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments. Current Protocols in Human Genetics is the comprehensive resource for all types of research and clinical laboratory approaches pertaining to human genetics. Current Protocols in Human Genetics brings together hundreds of core and cutting edge techniques in all branches of genetics including: Genetic Mapping Genotyping Cytogenetics Identifying Candidate Genes Identifying Sequence Variants Clinical Cytogenetics Clinical Molecular Genetics Cancer Genetics Transcriptional Profiling Gene Therapy Forensic Genetics Model Systems for the Analysis of Human Disease Biochemical Genetics High‐Throughput Sequencing Mitochondrial Genetics Epigenetics iPS Cell Models.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11700154206&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11700154206\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The primary aim is to promote a high standard of clinically related scholarship which advances and supports the practice and discipline of nursing. The Journal also aims to promote the international exchange of ideas and experience that draws from the different cultures in which practice takes place. Further, JCN seeks to enrich insight into clinical need and the implications for nursing intervention and models of service delivery. Emphasis is placed on promoting critical debate on the art and science of nursing practice. JCN is essential reading for anyone involved in nursing practice, whether clinicians, researchers, educators, managers, policy makers, or students. The development of clinical practice and the changing patterns of inter-professional working are also central to JCN's scope of interest. Contributions are welcomed from other health professionals on issues that have a direct impact on nursing practice.

Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences offers an international publication platform for basic as well as applied research; we encourage contributions spanning both established and emerging areas of biology. To this end, the journal draws from empirical disciplines such as structural biology, enzymology, biochemistry, and biophysics, capitalizing as well on the technological advancements that have enabled metabolomics and proteomics measurements in massively parallel throughput, and the development of robust and innovative computational biology strategies. We also recognize influences from medicine and technology, welcoming studies in molecular genetics, molecular diagnostics and therapeutics, and nanotechnology. Our ultimate objective is the comprehensive illustration of the molecular mechanisms regulating proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and small metabolites in organisms across all branches of life. In addition to interesting new findings, techniques, and applications, Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences will consider new testable hypotheses to inspire different perspectives and stimulate scientific dialogue. The integration of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches will benefit endeavors across all domains of the life sciences.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100843667&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100843667\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It advances debates on the spatialization of politics and the politicization of spatial relations. The journal welcomes original contributions that integrate empirical and theoretical analyses to engage, advance, challenge, and reframe debates about the political. Politics and Space values a wide range of critical and radical perspectives and encourages new theorizations, novel methodologies, and decentring ontologies. This is a global journal that supports and welcomes scholarship produced from and about all regions of the world. It encourages scholarship that engages marginalized and oppressed standpoints and critically engages hegemonic forms of power. The journal aims to push the boundaries and potential of research on the political and the spatial by exploring questions including: What is the status of the political in such research? How does thinking politics spatially help us understand pressing contemporary concerns in the world? And how can or should researchers act politically through their scholarship? The editors welcome empirically-oriented contributions as well as work that is more conceptual. The substantive scope of Politics and Space extends from urban politics to the politics of international institutions; from political economies of development and empire to political geographies of mobilities and identities; from geopolitics to the governance of environmental crises; and from the spatialities of states and sovereign power to the geographies of social justice. Papers should advance knowledge on the intersection of the spatial and the political in any area of the social sciences or humanities.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Science

Within this context, practice is part of the learning process, where change (through rigorous and invariably evidence-based research) in existing frameworks, models and methods yields new ideas in a process of continuous discovery. The Journal publishes research on all aspects of innovation (viewed here broadly to include not only product/service and process but also market, and organization) management in organizational contexts. This includes the study of the process in its entirety or individual stages, issues around accessing and using effectively tangible and intangible resources, innovation strategies, different tools used to manage innovation, the impact of industrial, regional, and national factors, and implications on performance. The European Journal of Innovation Management welcomes particularly work that explores innovation management in new contexts (such as – but not only – services, public sector organizations, and social and community enterprises (social innovation)), at one or multiple levels (including team or project, organizational, regional, national and international). Papers that appear in the EJIM, though often grounded on rigorous empirical research, should be explicit about implications for theory and practice.

In attempting to strike this balance, the journal presents work that makes complex language data accessible to those unfamiliar with the language area being studied and work that makes complex theoretical positions more accessible to those working outside the theoretical framework under review. Natural Language & Linguistic Theory features: generative studies on the syntax, semantics, phonology, morphology, and other aspects of natural language; surveys of recent theoretical developments that facilitate accessibility for a graduate student readership; reactions/replies to recent papers book reviews of important linguistics titles; special topic issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=25004&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=25004\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In its broadest sense, the system dynamics approach encompasses model-based analysis of dynamic problems with a systems approach, focusing on endogenous, structural sources of the dynamics of interest. Depending on the characteristics of a given problem, different modeling tools, methods and software can be used with this endogenous dynamic perspective. Applications include social, technical, managerial, business, economic, health, biological, ecological and environmental problems, among others. The publication goals of Review include but are not limited to: advances in modelling and simulation methods for dynamic feedback problems; advances in policy analysis methods based on feedback causality; modeling applications in diverse domains; generic structures (feedback structures that support widely applicable behavioural insights); system dynamics contributions to theory building in the social and natural sciences; contributions to the analysis, and applications of complex nonlinear dynamics; policy studies and debate emphasizing the role of feedback causality in dynamic problems of concern; developments in strategies for simulation-based consulting and implementation of model-based policy suggestions; advances in methods and applications of systems thinking relevant to dynamic feedback problems; contributions to system dynamics education and teaching.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management of Technology and

Historically, as the name suggests, the journal focused on a comparison among species to uncover the intricacies of how the brain functions. In modern times, this research is called systems neuroscience where animal models are used to mimic core cognitive processes with the ultimate goal of understanding neural circuits and connections that give rise to behavioral patterns and different neural states. Research published in JCN covers all species from invertebrates to humans, and the reports inform the readers about the function and organization of nervous systems in species with an emphasis on the way that species adaptations inform about the function or organization of the nervous systems, rather than on their evolution per se. JCN publishes primary research articles and critical commentaries and review-type articles offering expert insight in to cutting edge research in the field of systems neuroscience; a complete list of contribution types is given in the Author Guidelines. For primary research contributions, only full-length investigative reports are desired; the journal does not accept short communications.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16689&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16689\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Economic Theory's scope encompasses - but is not limited to - the following fields. - classical and modern equilibrium theory - cooperative and non-cooperative game theory - macroeconomics - social choice and welfare - uncertainty and information, intertemporal economics (including dynamical systems) - public economics - international and developmental economics - financial economics, money and banking - industrial organization Economic Theory also publishes surveys if they clearly picture the basic ideas at work in some areas, the essential technical apparatus which is used and the central questions which remain open. The development of a productive dialectic between stylized facts and abstract formulations requires that economic relevance be at the forefront. Thus, correct, and innovative, mathematical analysis is not enough; it must be motivated by - and contribute to - the understanding of substantive economic problems.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28488&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=28488\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Articles can be classified under the following categories: Bioenergetics; Biophysics, Cell fate determination (cell cycle, cell differentiation, cell death); Chemical Biology; Computation Biology (genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics); Cytoskeleton; Development; Ezymology; Evolution; Genome organization and stability; Glycobiology; Immunology; Membrane Biology (membrane trafficking, vesicles, organelles); Metabolism; Microbiology; Molecular basis of disease; Neuroscience; Plant Biology; Protein Chemistry; Protein Homeostasis; Redox Biology; Regulation of gene expression; RNA Biology; Signal Transduction; Structural Biology; Synthetic Biology; Systems Biology; and Virology. As a general policy, FEBS Letters does not consider preliminary or fragmentary observations, cloning and sequencing of cDNA or genes that have previously been reported for other species, conventionally achieved expression or crystallization of proteins, description of the effect of a drug or reagent without elucidation of a detailed molecular mechanism, correlative studies or negative observations. Moreover, methodological papers are considered for publication only when they are truly novel and significant, and interesting to a broad readership.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell

It is open to both established and innovative approaches to sociolinguistic research. The Journal promotes sociolinguistics as a thoroughly linguistic and thoroughly social-scientific endeavour. The linguistic and the social are both expected to be present in all contributions. Language is regarded as not only a reflection of society but as itself constituting much of the character of social life. The Journal promotes the building and critique of sociolinguistic theory and encourages the application of social theory to linguistic issues. The Journal is hospitable to linguistic analyses ranging from the micro to the macro, from the quantitative study of phonological variables to discourse analysis of texts. It is open to data from a wide range of languages and international contexts. Contributions from the ethnographic, variationist, constructivist and sociology of language traditions are welcomed, as are papers from the social psychology of language, anthropological linguistics, discourse analysis, language and gender studies, pragmatics and conversational analysis.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"History and Philosophy of

LCA has become a recognized instrument to assess the ecological burdens and impacts throughout the consecutive and interlinked stages of a product system, from raw material acquisition or generation from natural resources, through production and use to final disposal. The Int J Life Cycle Assess is a forum for scientists developing LCA and LCM (Life Cycle Management); LCA and LCM practitioners; managers concerned with environmental aspects of products; governmental environmental agencies responsible for product quality; scientific and industrial societies involved in LCA development, and ecological institutions and bodies. Papers on applied LCA/LCM, especially case studies, will be considered for publication if they are of general interest to the LCA/LCM community and make an innovative contribution to science such as highlighting new insights into a particular product system or policy question, such as a product that has been rarely or never assessed; a special interest operation, e.g. hydrofracking or Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS); present novel methodology; or describe efforts to build life cycle thinking capability within an organization or region. In addition to LCA/LCM, papers on Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) and Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) are also welcome. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) studies are considered for publication in the framework of LCSA (three pillar concept/triple bottom line).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23271&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23271\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Career Development International provides a platform for research in these areas that deals with questions of theories and theory development, as well as with organizational career strategy, policy and practice. Issues of theory and of practice may be dealt with at individual, organizational and society levels. The international character of submissions may have two aspects. Submissions may be international in their scope, dealing with a topic that is of concern to researchers throughout the world rather than of sole interest to a national audience. Alternatively, submissions may be international in content, relating, for example, to comparative analyses of careers and development across national boundaries, or dealing with inherently 'international' issues such as expatriation.

We publish original research articles, reviews and correspondence. Original research articles must show how they advance the field, with novelty and scientific rigor being the two most important criteria for publication. Advances should increase biological understanding or have diagnostic or therapeutic potential. We encourage research articles using animal models in addition to human studies. Interdisciplinary approaches are particularly welcome. We favour mechanistic papers that test a hypothesis. Clinical studies will be considered but observational clinical studies are more appropriate for submission to Human Reproduction.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell

The word “biofactors” refers to the many compounds that regulate biological functions. Biological factors comprise many molecules produced or modified by living organisms, and present in many essential systems like the blood, the nervous or immunological systems. A non-exhaustive list of biological factors includes neurotransmitters, cytokines, chemokines, hormones, coagulation factors, transcription factors, signaling molecules, receptor ligands and many more. In the group of biofactors we can accommodate several classical molecules not synthetized in the body such as vitamins, micronutrients or essential trace elements. In keeping with this unified view of biochemistry, BioFactors publishes research dealing with the identification of new substances and the elucidation of their functions at the biophysical, biochemical, cellular and human level as well as studies revealing novel functions of already known biofactors. The journal encourages the submission of studies that use biochemistry, biophysics, cell and molecular biology and/or cell signaling approaches.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical

In addition, the interplay between a pathogen and its host cell has become increasingly important to understand and interfere with diseases caused by microbial pathogens. IJMM meets these needs by focussing on genome and proteome analyses, studies dealing with the molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity and the evolution of pathogenic agents, the interactions between pathogens and host cells (\"cellular microbiology\"), and molecular epidemiology. To help the reader keeping up with the rapidly evolving new findings in the field of medical microbiology, IJMM publishes original articles, case studies and topical, state-of-the-art mini-reviews in a well balanced fashion. All articles are strictly peer-reviewed. Important topics are reinforced by 2 special issues per year dedicated to a particular theme. Finally, at irregular intervals, current opinions on recent or future developments in medical microbiology are presented in an editorial section.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Infectious

The journal will consider for publication: i) solicited or unsolicited reviews of topical areas of stem cell biology that highlight, critique and synthesize recent important findings in the field. ii) full length and short reports presenting original experimental work. iii) translational stem cell studies describing results of clinical trials using stem cells as therapeutics. iv) papers focused on diseases of stem cells. v) hypothesis and commentary articles as opinion-based pieces in which authors can propose a new theory, interpretation of a controversial area in stem cell biology, or a stem cell biology question or paradigm. These articles contain more speculation than reviews, but they should be based on solid rationale. vi) protocols as peer-reviewed procedures that provide step-by-step descriptions, outlined in sufficient detail, so that both experts and novices can apply them to their own research. vii) letters to the editor and correspondence. In order to facilitate this exchange of scientific information and exciting novel ideas, the journal has created five thematic sections, focusing on: i) the role of adult stem cells in tissue regeneration; ii) progress in research on induced pluripotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells and mechanism governing embryogenesis and tissue development; iii) the role of microenvironment and extracellular microvesicles in directing the fate of stem cells; iv) mechanisms of stem cell trafficking, stem cell mobilization and homing with special emphasis on hematopoiesis; v) the role of stem cells in aging processes and cancerogenesis.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17400154824&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17400154824\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
