Of particular relevance are descriptions of empirical research and the presentation of theory designed to either explicate or enhance the educational process. The journal places great value on the quality of research methodology. This includes the participant sample being representative of the intended population (and not just a sample of convenience), measures having demonstrated psychometric quality including both reliability and validity (avoiding, for example, excessive reliance on self-report measures), literature reviews that support the methods employed, and analyses that are both appropriate and accurately described. The journal publishes quantitative, qualitative, and single-subject design studies that involve the application of psychological science to an important educational process, issue, or problem. The journal does not limit its scope to any age range. Articles dealing with the education of preschoolers, K-12 children, adults, and the elderly are all relevant if they apply psychological theory and science to the process of education.

The emphasis is on quantitative or analytical work, which is novel and relevant. The Journal does not publish book reviews. We welcome papers that take up questions in development economics that are of interest to the general readers of the journal, and then use data from a particular country or region to answer them. However, we do not publish articles that are essentially in-depth studies of a specific country, region, case, or event whose findings are unlikely to be of great interest to the general readers of the journal. In our review process we pre-screen all papers, some of which are immediately rejected. This includes papers that are not considered to be a good fit in terms of the topic or the methodology even though development is a broad field and sometimes this is a matter of subjective judgment. This also includes papers that fall short of our high standards, in terms of the contribution or value added to the literature, or in terms of methodological rigor. The Journal receives approx. 1300 papers per year and publishes only a small fraction (around 6-8%). To make this work in a timely fashion we only send 1/4 papers out for review. Given this volume we regret that we cannot provide explanations on our desk reject papers. Under normal circumstances, an author cannot submit (either s/he directly or through a co-author) more than three papers within any 12 month period. Papers that are once rejected by the JDE will not be considered for publication again, even if the authors use a new dataset or a new model. This is only possible if the editor in his or her decision letter explicitly leaves open this possibility.

By providing insightful and balanced contributions the journal strives to highlight key topics that are on the cutting edge of climate change research. All articles are peer-reviewed by specialists in the field for their accuracy and objectivity. We accomplish this aim by appointing eminent authorities to serve as Section Editors in key subject areas across the field, such as aerosols, decadal predictability, human health, global energy budgets, and sea level projections. Section Editors, in turn, select topics for which leading experts contribute comprehensive review articles that emphasize new developments and recently published papers of major importance. Every manuscript undergoes a single-blind peer-review process in which at least two outside reviewers assess the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the papers and offer recommendations for revisions. An acclaimed and highly selective international Editorial Board reviews the annual table of contents, suggests articles of special interest to their respective fields, and ensures that topics are current and include emerging research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100873474&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100873474\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This tradition continues today, and TiG remains a favorite in the community for its distinctive content. As the field has changed, though, so too has the scope of the journal, which now encompasses new areas, such as genomics, epigenetics, and computational genetics, while continuing to cover traditional subjects like transcriptional regulation, population genetics, and chromosome biology. The core aim of the journal, however, is still to provide researchers and students with high-quality, novel reviews, commentaries, and discussions and, above all, to foster an appreciation for the advances being made on all fronts of genetic research. Each issue of TiG contains concise, lively and up-to-date Reviews and Opinions as well as a variety of shorter articles, such as Science & Society and Spotlight pieces.

Our readership is more diverse than that of specialist journals: as well as research scientists, also students, government agencies involved in programme support and management and in environmental assessment and control, private industries concerned with planetary resources, and the independent consultant. The journal's vision includes ensuring accessibility for all of these groups. Every review article published will advance existing knowledge and highlight new directions being taken at the forefront of expanding subject areas by synthesis, evaluation and discussion of previously published literature. The value of such articles to the readership is increased with comment and opinion provided by the author from a specific context. Authors may further enhance their article with the addition of supplementary material such as videos, datasets and applications. Articles may be extensive, providing comprehensive coverage of a relatively broad or cross-disciplinary subject area, or they may be much shorter providing an in-depth overview of a very specific topic, and authors may choose to include a proportion of their own primary research data to support their arguments. From time to time, 'Invited Earth-Science Reviews' will be published about topics of exceptional interest.

The word cement is interpreted in a wide sense, including not only Portland cement but also blended cements and other binding materials. In addition to novel aspects of conventional concrete materials, the journal covers a wide range of composite materials such as fiber-reinforced cement composites, polymer cement composites, polymer impregnated composites, ferrocement, and cement composites containing special aggregate inclusions or waste materials. Original papers dealing with microstructure (as it relates to engineering properties), material properties, testing and test methods, fracture mechanics, durability aspects, composite mechanics/technology, modelling, design, fabrication and practical applications of these materials form the major themes of the journal. Provided there is sufficient linkage to properties defined at the material scale, papers concerning the behavior of structural components and systems, in situ performance, and field studies will also be accepted for review, as well as those concerning the repair and maintenance, serviceability behavior, and sustainability of structures made with these materials.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Building and Construction","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23811&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23811\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Editors welcome research papers on the pedagogical uses of digital technology, where the focus is broad enough to be of interest to a wider education community. We do not publish small-scale evaluations of specific software/systems in specialist domains or particular courses in individual institutions (unless the findings have broader relevance that is explicitly drawn out in the paper). Papers that include discussions of the implementation of software and/or hardware should focus on the context of use, the user/system interface, usability issues and evaluations of the user experience and impacts on and particularly on the implications for learning and teaching. Computers as a delivery platform only is insufficient. Detailed information on implementation architecture should NOT be included in the paper, but may be provided via URLs. We welcome systematic review papers and meta-analyses that include clear research questions, a framework of analysis, and conclusions that reflect the aims of the paper. See PRISMA guidelines for further advice (here). Authors should take care to refer to and abide by the author guidelines. Papers that do not address the criteria outlined in the author guidelines will be returned without review.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science

The application of our of the biochemistry, chemistry and physiology of lipids to biotechnology, the fats and oils industry and medicine have continued to expand apace. In addition new dimensions such as lipid biophysics, especially with relevance to membranes and lipoproteins, and basic liposome research and applications have been added. To cope with all these advances in knowledge a journal is needed to review recent progress in particular fields and to set current research against its historical background. Progress in Lipid Research fulfils this role. Each volume contains up-to-date surveys of special aspects of lipid research. The invited reviews are comprehensive enough to provide sufficient overview but concentrate on reporting and critically appraising the most recent data. Subjects are chosen for their timeliness or because major developments have taken place in the last few years. They include methodological reviews as well as chemical, biochemical and medical articles. All lipid compounds and derivatives are covered, ranging from fatty acids and other simple molecules, through steroids, terpenoids and phospho- or glycolipids to complex structures such as lipoproteins and biological membranes. We hope that those whose main interest is in lipid biophysics and liposome research will join as new readers, benefiting from the journal's classical aspects of lipid metabolism, lipids in signal transduction and lipid enzymology, and that current readers will benefit from the exposure to top quality research on the new aspects.

The journal is produced by Sheridan Journal Services, Waterbury, VT. Within three years of its initial publication in 1989, The Plant Cell ranked first in impact among journals publishing primary research in the plant sciences. It has continued to maintain this standard of excellence ever since. The Plant Cell publishes novel research of special significance in plant biology, especially in the areas of cellular biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, development, and evolution. The primary criteria for publication are that the article provides new insight that is of broad interest to plant biologists, not only to specialists, and that the presentation of results is appropriate for a wide audience of plant biologists. The Plant Cell was founded on four key tenets: (1) to publish the most exciting, cutting-edge research in plant cellular and molecular biology, (2) to provide the most rapid turnaround time possible for reviewing and publishing a research paper, (3) to feature the highest quality reproduction of data, and (4) to provide, in the front section of the journal, a more interactive format for commentaries, opinion pieces, and the exchange of information and ideas in review articles, meeting reports, and insightful overviews of featured research papers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16594&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16594\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Scope Human Relations seeks high quality research papers that extend our knowledge of social relationships at work and organizational forms, practices and processes that affect the nature, structure and conditions of work and work organizations. Human Relations welcomes manuscripts that seek to cross disciplinary boundaries in order to develop new perspectives and insights into social relationships and relationships between people and organizations. Human Relations encourages strong empirical contributions that develop and extend theory as well as more conceptual papers that integrate, critique and expand existing theory. Human Relations welcomes critical reviews and essays: - Critical reviews advance a field through new theory, new methods, a novel synthesis of extant evidence, or a combination of two or three of these elements. Reviews that identify new research questions and that make links between management and organizations and the wider social sciences are particularly welcome. Surveys or overviews of a field are unlikely to meet these criteria. - Critical essays address contemporary scholarly issues and debates within the journal's scope. They are more controversial than conventional papers or reviews, and can be shorter. They argue a point of view, but must meet standards of academic rigour. Anyone with an idea for a critical essay is particularly encouraged to discuss it at an early stage with the Editor-in-Chief. Human Relations encourages research that relates social theory to social practice and translates knowledge about human relations into prospects for social action and policy-making that aims to improve working lives.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities

This new international forum, edited by a highly respected team, provides a leading environment for review, theory, and conceptual development. HPR contributes to the advancement of the discipline of health psychology and strengthens its relationship to the field of psychology as a whole, as well as to other related academic and professional arenas. It is essential reading for those engaged in the study, teaching, and practice of health psychology, behavioral medicine, and associated areas. HPR is dedicated to theoretical and conceptual work, as well as evaluative, integrative, meta-analytic and systematic reviews and interpretations of substantive issues in the general domain of health psychology. The journal particularly favors theory-based reviews of empirical contributions that afford integrative theoretical formulations of work in a given area of health psychology and reviews of developments that develop connections between areas of research within the general domain of health psychology as well as with other disciplines (ranging from biology to policy-oriented research domains). Papers that consider the cross-cultural and cross-national relevance and appropriateness of theories and key concepts are also welcomed. Articles focusing on methodological issues and problems of design and measurement will be considered if they make a direct and substantial contribution to theory. Brief commentaries addressing progress in specific sub-fields of health psychology, comments that apply to existing theoretical models and approaches, and discussions about previously published articles, can also be considered.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19400158464&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19400158464\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

JWB publishes cutting-edge research that reflects important developments in the global business environment and advances new theoretical directions and ways of thinking about global phenomena. The journal especially encourages submissions that break new ground or demonstrate novel or counterintuitive findings in relation to established theories or assumptions and welcomes a variety of conceptual and theoretical traditions, including those drawn from allied social and behavioral sciences. Submissions should develop new and/or test existing theory, and empirical papers may employ a range of qualitative, quantitative and other methodologies so long as they are rigorous and appropriate. Although JWB's primary readers are scholars and researchers, the journal values contributions that explore and explicate implications for global enterprises and their managers, as well as consequences for public policy and the broader role of business in society. JWB welcomes manuscripts in the following areas: Global Political and Economic Environment; Strategic Management; Organizational Behavior; Cross-Cultural Management; Leadership; Human Resources Management; Ethics, Social Responsibility and Sustainability; Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship. While manuscripts may focus on a single country or small group of countries, all submissions should reflect some cross-border or comparative dimensions, or explore and advance other issues affecting international business, consistent with the global scope of the journal.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business

The Journal has a broad scope, covering the key issues for effective drug and gene delivery, from administration to site-specific delivery. In general, the Journal publishes review articles in a Theme Issue format. Each Theme Issue provides a comprehensive and critical examination of current and emerging research on the design and development of advanced drug and gene delivery systems and their application to experimental and clinical therapeutics. The goal is to illustrate the pivotal role of a multidisciplinary approach to modern drug delivery, encompassing the application of sound biological and physicochemical principles to the engineering of drug delivery systems to meet the therapeutic need at hand. Importantly the Editorial Team of ADDR asks that the authors effectively window the extensive volume of literature, pick the important contributions and explain their importance, produce a forward looking identification of the challenges facing the field and produce a Conclusions section with expert recommendations to address the issues. Articles review the current status of a specific topic, giving equal emphasis to the identification of major conceptual and technological challenges to successful drug and gene delivery, to an evaluation of triumphs as well as shortcomings in current conceptual and technical approaches, and to a discussion of their possible solution.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmaceutical Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19409&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19409\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
