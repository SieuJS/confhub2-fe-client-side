Given the multifaceted, multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder character of the tourism economy, this focus implies a concern for both the public and private sector spheres of interest as well as economic, socio-cultural, political, environmental, legal, technological, and demographic issues. Specific goals are to be international in scope with geographic diversity, to be multidisciplinary with diversity in research topics and methodologies, and to be germane to the needs of the travel and tourism industry and its stakeholders. All manuscripts published in the Journal of Travel Research are double-blind, peer-reviewed by accomplished scholars in the topical area. The standard for publication in the Journal of Travel Research is that a paper must make a substantive contribution, either theoretically or methodologically, to the travel and tourism research literature. Additionally, a paper should specify its contribution to pragmatic tourism management concerns and practice. Published manuscripts must be on research of the highest standards, on topics of major significance and widespread interest, and relevant to the progress of this important global sector.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and

Ageing research is now the focus of thousands of laboratories that include leaders in the areas of genetics, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, and behaviour. Ageing Research Reviews (ARR) covers the trends in this field. It is designed to fill a large void, namely, a source for critical reviews and viewpoints on emerging findings on mechanisms of ageing and age-related disease. Rapid advances in understanding of mechanisms that control cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival are leading to new insight into the regulation of ageing. From telomerase to stem cells to energy and oxyradical metabolism, this is an exciting new era in the multidisciplinary field of ageing research. The cellular and molecular underpinnings of manipulations that extend lifespan, such as caloric restriction, are being identified and novel approaches for preventing age-related diseases are being developed. ARR publishes articles on focussed topics selected from the broad field of ageing research, with an emphasis on cellular and molecular mechanisms of the aging process and age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. Applications of basic ageing research to lifespan extension and disease prevention are also covered in this journal.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular

The focus of the Transactions will be on “cognitive” behaviors in all aspects of communications and network control, from the PHY functions (including hardware) through the applications (including architecture), and in all kinds of communication networks and systems regardless of type of traffic, transmission media, operating environment, or capabilities of communicating devices. IEEE TCCN will welcome papers dealing with the design, analysis, evaluation, experimentation and testing of cognitive communications and network systems. Inter-disciplinary approaches are encouraged. Papers that focus on experimental infrastructures or tools for cognitive communications and networking will also be considered, provided that they contain significant original contributions in the communications or networking areas. Since the term “cognitive” may be interpreted in multiple ways, we define here a cognitive entity as one that is capable of selecting and carrying out actions depending on its own goals and its perception of the world and that may also be capable of learning from experience by interacting with the world. Thus, a cognitive entity means an intelligent entity which possesses the following basic components: perception, learning/reasoning and decision making.

Concerned primarily with critical reviews of current research, PiHG enables a space for debate about questions, concepts and findings of formative influence in human geography. It is published six times per year in paper format and - in Online First - continuously in electronic format. The six editors of PiHG are supported by an international Editorial Advisory Board. Four major strands - Perspectives, Reviews, Biographies and Key Publications - shape the agenda setting content of the journal. In combination, these strands make PiHG the most innovative, distinctive and wide-ranging journal of human geography today. They enable it to offer critically informed and diverse accounts of the intellectual traditions and contemporary developments that shape and direct human geographical research and teaching.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12442&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12442\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Undoubtedly, uncovering new frontiers in chemistry will have significant impact on many of the imposing challenges facing our world today. The journal offers readable, multidisciplinary review, opinion, and short articles that are thoughtfully designed to keep students and leading scientists alike updated on the most pressing issues in the field. The journal highlights all aspects of analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, and theoretical chemistry with major themes including: biochemistry, catalysis, colloids, environmental chemistry, materials, medicine, polymers, and supramolecular chemistry. Additionally, we welcome articles on chemical education; health and safety; policy and public relations; and ethics and law. Articles for Trends in Chemistry are peer-reviewed and generally commissioned by the editor, however, proposals are encouraged. Because chemistry intersects many other scientific disciplines such as biology, computer science, mathematics, and physics, the audience for Trends in Chemistry is broad. Accordingly, we emphasize readable articles that minimize field-specific language and abbreviations. Please note that we cannot accept manuscripts that rely on unpublished data.

Research should… > Extend or test existing theoretical bases in supply management or contribute to theory building in supply chain management; > Use rigorous empirical methodologies and analyses which address the multiple dimensions of validity; and > Clarify and enhance understanding of the role of various aspects of supply chain management in the global competitiveness of organizations. An article published in the Journal of Supply Chain Management must make a strong contribution to supply chain management theory. This contribution can occur through an inductive, theory-building process or a deductive, theory-testing approach, both of which may occur in a variety of ways (for example, falsification of conventional understanding, theory-building through conceptual development or inductive or qualitative research, initial empirical testing of a theory, theoretically based meta analysis or constructive replication that clarifies the boundaries or range of a theory). Manuscripts should explicitly convey the theoretical contribution relative to the existing supply chain management literature and, where appropriate, the existing literature outside of supply chain management (for example, management theory, psychology, economics). Manuscripts published in JSCM must also make strong empirical contributions. While purely conceptual manuscripts are welcomed, these papers must significantly advance theory in the field of supply chain management and need to be strongly grounded in extant theory and relevant literature. For most empirical manuscripts, whether quantitative or qualitative, authors must adequately assess validity, the sine qua non of empirical research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics,

Trends in Molecular Medicine is a resource for students and professionals alike, who have information needs that transcend the traditional clinical or scientific categorisation. Trends in Molecular Medicine includes review articles on the genetic basis of disease, but 'molecular' does not only mean DNA. The diagnostic role of genetic processes is clear, but major benefits in health and disease are also provided by other molecules: enzymes, antibiotics, hormones, metals, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, synthetic organic and inorganic polymers. Such benefits are discussed and evaluated by Trends in Molecular Medicine. Furthermore 'Medicine' involves a vital societal element; molecular intervention raises controversial ethical, legal and financial issues. All these issues are addressed in Trends in Molecular Medicine in a style that builds on 25 years' experience of publishing the Trends Journals.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=20205&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=20205\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

ESD solicits contributions that investigate these various interactions and the underlying mechanisms, ways how these can be conceptualized, modelled, and quantified, predictions of the overall system behaviour to global changes, and the impacts for its habitability, humanity, and future Earth system management by human decision making.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900192023&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900192023\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The contributions are written by leading researchers in each field and commissioned as Subject Collections by a board of eminent academic editors, all of whom are acknowledged to be key figures in their particular fields. These Subject Collections gradually accumulate articles as new issues of the journal are published and, when complete, each represents a comprehensive survey of the field it covers.
