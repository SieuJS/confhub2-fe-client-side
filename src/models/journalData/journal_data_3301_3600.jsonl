Transport dynamics can be considered from various scales and scopes ranging from dynamics in traffic flow, travel behavior (e.g. learning process), logistics, transport policy, to traffic control. Thus, the journal welcomes research papers that address transport dynamics from a broad perspective, ranging from theoretical studies to empirical analysis of transport systems or behavior based on actual data. The scope of Transportmetrica B includes, but is not limited to, the following: dynamic traffic assignment, dynamic transit assignment, dynamic activity-based modeling, applications of system dynamics in transport planning, logistics planning and optimization, traffic flow analysis, dynamic programming in transport modeling and optimization, traffic control, land-use and transport dynamics, day-to-day learning process (model and behavioral studies), time-series analysis of transport data and demand, traffic emission modeling, time-dependent transport policy analysis, transportation network reliability and vulnerability, simulation of traffic system and travel behavior, longitudinal analysis of traveler behavior, etc.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Software","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100241736&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100241736\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We welcome submissions from a variety of disciplinary or multidisciplinary perspectives, ranging from political science and political economy to public administration, law, history, sociology and cultural studies. However, the primary emphasis is on the discussion of European integration in the fields of political science and international relations. We understand European integration broadly, as pan-European process rather than merely the European Union, though the majority of our contributions might be devoted to the latter. We also publish comparative studies of federalism, regional integration and other forms of multilateral cooperation, as well as articles dealing with the European Union’s external relations and its global role, be it concerning economic, diplomatic or security relations.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5700162364&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5700162364\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers should make an original contribution to at least one technical area and should in addition illuminate issues beyond that area's boundaries. Even excellent papers in a narrow field of interest are not appropriate for the journal. Papers can be oriented toward theory, experimentation, algorithms, numerical simulations, or applications as long as the work is creative and sound. Excessively theoretical work in which the application to natural phenomena is not apparent (at least through similar techniques) or in which the development of fundamental methodologies is not present is probably not appropriate. In turn, papers oriented toward experimentation, numerical simulations, or applications must not simply report results without an indication of what a theoretical explanation might be. All papers should be submitted in English and must meet common standards of usage and grammar. In addition, because ours is a multidisciplinary subject, at minimum the introduction to the paper should be readable to a broad range of scientists and not only to specialists in the subject area. The scientific importance of the paper and its conclusions should be made clear in the introduction-this means that not only should the problem you study be presented, but its historical background, its relevance to science and technology, the specific phenomena it can be used to describe or investigate, and the outstanding open issues related to it should be explained. Failure to achieve this could disqualify the paper.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied

Our aim is to provide rigorous peer review and enable rapid publication of cutting-edge research to educate and inspire the scientific community worldwide. We encourage scientists to publish their experimental, theoretical, and computational results in as much detail as possible, in a regular section (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/sections) or in a Special Issue (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/special_issues). Therefore, there is no restriction on the length of the papers or the number of electronic multimedia and supplementary files. For all articles, the full experimental details must be provided so that the results can be reproduced. Electronic files regarding the full details of the experimental procedure, if unable to be published in a normal way, can be deposited as supplementary material (including animated pictures, videos, interactive Excel sheets, software executables and others). Manuscript categories: original scientific research articles, comprehensive reviews, communications, case reports, letters, commentaries, editorials, etc. In the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, molecules are the object of study; among those studies, we find: fundamental theoretical problems of broad interest in biology, chemistry and medicine; breakthrough experimental technical progress of broad interest in biology, chemistry and medicine; and application of the theories and novel technologies to specific experimental studies and calculations.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=25879&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=25879\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

AHD is the official journal of the Society for Emotion and Attachment Studies (SEAS) and the official journal of the International Attachment Network (IAN). AHD publishes original research, meta-analytic reviews (and occasionally) narrative reviews based on attachment theory. Submissions that include multi-method approaches (including interviews or observations), and a longitudinal design, are especially welcome. While reliance on widely used and previously validated methods is the norm, AHD also publishes papers that introduce new attachment methods. Intergenerational patterns of attachment, emotion-regulation, children’s social and emotional development, the effects of loss and trauma, are common topics addressed by the journal. Submissions that include physiological or genetic data, together with attachment variables, addressing core questions in developmental science are welcome. Submissions typically include attachment as a predictor or an outcome, or attachment as a moderator or mediator of developmental outcomes. AHD aims to be the source for reliable and valid research, and reviews, based on the theories advanced by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth.

Clinical, diagnostic and basic science research is expanding rapidly. There is increasing demand from purchasers of health care and patients for clinicians to keep abreast of the latest research and developments, and to translate these into routine practice. Technological advances in diagnosis, surgical technique, new pharmaceuticals, molecular genetics and other basic sciences have transformed many aspects of how these diseases are managed. Such progress will accelerate. Colorectal Disease offers a real benefit to subscribers and authors. It is first and foremost a vehicle for publishing original research relating to the demanding, rapidly expanding field of colorectal diseases. Essential for surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, gastroenterologists and health professionals caring for patients with a disease of the lower GI tract, Colorectal Disease furthers education and inter-professional development by including regular review articles and discussions of current controversies. Note that the journal does not usually accept paediatric surgical papers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gastroenterology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28281&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=28281\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Although we publish articles motivated by applications in the biomedical sciences (for example, clinical medicine, health care, population health, and translational bioinformatics), the journal emphasizes reports of new methodologies and techniques that have general applicability and that form the basis for the evolving science of biomedical informatics. Articles on medical devices; evaluations of implemented systems (including clinical trials of information technologies); or papers that provide insight into a biological process, a specific disease, or treatment options would generally be more suitable for publication in other venues. Papers on applications of signal processing and image analysis are often more suitable for biomedical engineering journals or other informatics journals, although we do publish papers that emphasize the information management and knowledge representation/modeling issues that arise in the storage and use of biological signals and images. System descriptions are welcome if they illustrate and substantiate the underlying methodology that is the principal focus of the report and an effort is made to address the generalizability and/or range of application of that methodology. Note also that, given the international nature of JBI, papers that deal with specific languages other than English, or with country-specific health systems or approaches, are acceptable for JBI only if they offer generalizable lessons that are relevant to the broad JBI readership, regardless of their country, language, culture, or health system.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23706&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23706\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In this context, the ability of senior managers to understand the culture and dynamics of organizations and to deliver strong leadership during periods of transformation and change, could be the difference between organizational failure and success. The journal explores the practical application of leadership and organization development theory in order to identify its relevance for managerial practice. Leadership & Organization Development Journal focuses on the interpretation of research and how the results of research may be translated into practice. It addresses a broad range of topics which are relevant to organizations and reflective of societal developments. The journal supports interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary approaches to the study of leadership and organization development and encourages original thinking which will contribute to knowledge and understanding in these areas. LODJ strongly encourages articles based on empirical work founded on a strong literature base and which provide a basis for theoretical development to advance the field. The journal has no methodological preference: papers on the continuum from quantitative data-based studies to qualitative case studies are equally welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting

The journal seeks to advance interdisciplinary environmental research and its use to support novel solutions in environmental policy and governance. The journal publishes innovative, high quality articles which examine, or are relevant to, the environmental policies that are introduced by governments or the diverse forms of environmental governance that emerge in markets and civil society. The journal includes papers that examine how different forms of policy and governance emerge and exert influence at scales ranging from local to global and in diverse developmental and environmental contexts. The journal invites analyses that are at the forefront of academic debates and that are of practical significance and policy relevance. Each volume includes guest-edited special issues on themes deemed to be of widespread interest and importance. Environmental Policy and Governance is deliberately inter-disciplinary, seeking to publish articles that build the understanding of environmental issues not only by drawing upon and contributing to the environmental social sciences, but also by linking the social and natural sciences. The journal accommodates and encourages methodological innovation and diversity in order to foster interdisciplinary, problem-oriented environmental research. All manuscripts and special issues are reviewed by an international panel of referees, with an aim of returning constructive comments on submitted manuscripts in a timely way. The editorial strategy and the review processes of Environmental Policy and Governance are guided by an active editorial board consisting of leading academics from different regions and disciplines. The editors cordially invite the submission of manuscripts and proposals for special issues.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17700156312&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17700156312\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It makes complex analysis of climate and development issues accessible to a wide audience of researchers, policymakers and practitioners, and facilitates debate between the diverse constituencies active in these fields throughout the world. The journal provides a forum to communicate research, review and discussion on the interfaces between climate, development, policy and practice. It presents conceptual, policy-analytical and empirical studies of the interactions between climate impacts, mitigation, adaptation and development on scales from the local to global. Contributions from and about developing countries are particularly encouraged; however, research on developed countries is welcome provided that the link between climate and development is the central theme. Climate and Development is of direct and vital relevance to academics, policy analysts, consultants, negotiators, industrial and non-governmental organisations, and to all those working to ensure a better understanding of the links between climate and development.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100198541&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100198541\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The global carbon cycle involves important couplings between climate, atmospheric CO2 and the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. The current transformation of the carbon cycle due to changes in climate and atmospheric composition is widely recognized as potentially dangerous for the biosphere and for the well-being of humankind, and therefore monitoring, understanding and predicting the evolution of the carbon cycle in the context of the whole biosphere (both terrestrial and marine) is a challenge to the scientific community. This demands interdisciplinary research and new approaches for studying geographical and temporal distributions of carbon pools and fluxes, control and feedback mechanisms of the carbon-climate system, points of intervention and windows of opportunity for managing the carbon-climate-human system. Carbon Balance and Management is a medium for researchers in the field to convey the results of their research across disciplinary boundaries. Through this dissemination of research, the journal aims to support the work of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and to provide governmental and non-governmental organizations with instantaneous access to continually emerging knowledge, including paradigm shifts and consensual views.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5800179606&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

The data utilized or treated range from the earliest archaeological evidence for the emergence of human culture to historically documented societies and the contemporary observations of the ethnographer, ethnoarchaeologist, sociologist, or geographer. These subjects appear in the journal as examples of cultural organization, operation, and evolution, not as specific historical phenomena.

There is a great deal of activity in design theory, coding theory and cryptography, including a substantial amount of research which brings together more than one of the subjects. While many journals exist for each of the individual areas, few encourage the interaction of the disciplines. The journal was founded to meet the needs of mathematicians, engineers and computer scientists working in these areas, whose interests extend beyond the bounds of any one of the individual disciplines. The journal provides a forum for high quality research in its three areas, with papers touching more than one of the areas especially welcome. The journal also considers high quality submissions in the closely related areas of finite fields and finite geometries, which provide important tools for both the construction and the actual application of designs, codes and cryptographic systems. In particular, it includes (mostly theoretical) papers on computational aspects of finite fields. It also considers topics in sequence design, which frequently admit equivalent formulations in the journal’s main areas. Designs, Codes and Cryptography is mathematically oriented, emphasizing the algebraic and geometric aspects of the areas it covers. The journal considers high quality papers of both a theoretical and a practical nature, provided they contain a substantial amount of mathematics.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=25862&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=25862\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Founded in 1927 it is the oldest scholarly public administration journal specifically focused on comparative and international topics. IRAS seeks to shape the future agenda of public administration around the world by encouraging reflection on international comparisons, new techniques and approaches, the dialogue between academics and practitioners, and debates about the future of the field itself. The IIAS exists to advance the study and practice of public administration and public management. It operates at a global level and is funded by states world-wide; but is independent of any of them and, through its links with the United Nations, seeks to develop a voice and vision that is neutral, as objective as possible and grounded in the exigency of the fact.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15807&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15807\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It is very important to know how a patient could be defined as improved or recovered, how long a treatment has to last, when therapy works and for whom. These are fundamental issues for Clinical Neuropsychiatry. The main goal of the journal is to collect original papers that directly or indirectly influence the effectiveness of a treatment, particularly focused on Evidence Based Medicine and Clinical Practice. All papers in this journal are peer-reviewed. No person is permitted to take any role in the review of a paper in which they have an interest, e.g., fees or grants from, employment by, consultancy for, shared ownership in, any close relationship with, an organisation whose interests, financial or otherwise, may be affected by the publication of the paper. Giovanni Fioriti Editore’s policy is to publish clinical issue done by experts in their field. All work published is rigorously checked – blind evaluation by at least one reviewer and two editors – whether it is an editorial, review, in-depth article, letter, or a case report.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5100152905&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5100152905\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Consequently, the processes involved in reading and writing and the failure to acquire these skills, as well as the loss of once well-developed reading and writing abilities have been the targets of intense research activity involving professionals from a variety of disciplines, such as neuropsychology, cognitive psychology, psycholinguistics and education. The findings that have emanated from this research are most often written up in a lingua that is specific to the particular discipline involved, and are published in specialized journals. This generally leaves the expert in one area almost totally unaware of what may be taking place in any area other than their own. Reading and Writing cuts through this fog of jargon, breaking down the artificial boundaries between disciplines. The journal focuses on the interaction among various fields, such as linguistics, information processing, neuropsychology, cognitive psychology, speech and hearing science and education.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics

This subspeciality addresses the two major psychological dimensions of cancer: the psychological responses of patients to cancer at all stages of the disease, and that of their families and caretakers; and the psychological, behavioral and social factors that may influence the disease process. Psycho-oncology is an area of multi-disciplinary interest and has boundaries with the major specialities in oncology: the clinical disciplines (surgery, medicine, pediatrics, radiotherapy), epidemiology, immunology, endocrinology, biology, pathology, bioethics, palliative care, rehabilitation medicine, clinical trials research and decision making, as well as psychiatry and psychology. This international journal is published twelve times a year and will consider contributions to research of clinical and theoretical interest. Topics covered are wide-ranging and relate to the psychosocial aspects of cancer and AIDS-related tumors, including: epidemiology, quality of life, palliative and supportive care, psychiatry, psychology, sociology, social work, nursing and educational issues. Special reviews are offered from time to time. There is a section reviewing recently published books. A society news section is available for the dissemination of information relating to meetings, conferences and other society-related topics. Summary proceedings of important national and international symposia falling within the aims of the journal are presented.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive

We focus on the interface of plant biology and soil sciences, and seek those manuscripts with a strong mechanistic component which develop and test hypotheses aimed at understanding underlying mechanisms of plant-soil interactions. Manuscripts can include both fundamental and applied aspects of mineral nutrition, plant water relations, symbiotic and pathogenic plant-microbe interactions, root anatomy and morphology, soil biology, ecology, agrochemistry and agrophysics, as long as they are hypothesis-driven and enhance our mechanistic understanding. Articles including a major molecular or modelling component also fall within the scope of the journal.

Yet, cultural structures and processes have proved surprisingly resilient. Relatively autonomous patterns of meaning - sweeping narratives and dividing codes, redolent if elusive symbols, fervent demands for purity and cringing fears of pollution - continue to exert extraordinary effects on action and institutions. They affect structures of inequality, racism and marginality, gender and sexuality, crime and punishment, social movements, market success and citizen incorporation. New and old new media project continuous symbolic reconstructions of private and public life. As contemporary sociology registered the continuing robustness of cultural power, the new discipline of cultural sociology was born. How should these complex cultural processes be conceptualized? What are the best empirical ways to study social meaning? Even as debates rage around these field-specific theoretical and methodological questions, a broadly cultural sensibility has spread into every arena of sociological study, illuminating how struggles over meaning affect the most disparate processes of contemporary social life. Bringing together the best of these studies and debates, the American Journal of Cultural Sociology (AJCS) publicly crystallizes the cultural turn in contemporary sociology. By providing a common forum for the many voices engaged in meaning-centered social inquiry, the AJCS will facilitate communication, sharpen contrasts, sustain clarity, and allow for periodic condensation and synthesis of different perspectives. The journal aims to provide a single space where cultural sociologists can follow the latest developments and debates within the field.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100385960&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100385960\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Topics of interest include instabilities and localization, interface and surface phenomena, fracture and failure, multi-physics and other time-dependent phenomena, micromechanics and multi-scale methods, and inverse analysis and stochastic methods. Papers related to energy and environmental issues are particularly welcome. The illustration of the proposed methods and techniques to engineering problems is encouraged. However, manuscripts dealing with applications of existing methods, or proposing incremental improvements to existing methods – in particular marginal extensions of existing analytical solutions or numerical methods – will not be considered for review.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computational Mechanics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computational

It provides a single forum for communication among neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiotherapists, medical oncologists, neuropathologists, neurodiagnosticians, and laboratory-based oncologists conducting relevant research. The Journal of Neuro-Oncology does not seek to isolate the field, but rather to focus the efforts of many disciplines in one publication through a format which pulls together these diverse interests. More than any other field of oncology, cancer of the central nervous system requires multi-disciplinary approaches. To alleviate having to scan dozens of journals of cell biology, pathology, laboratory and clinical endeavours, JNO is a periodical in which current, high-quality, relevant research in all aspects of neuro-oncology may be found.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cancer

Many studies of human behaviour in education are conducted by persons who identify with social psychology or whose work falls into the social psychological ambit. Several textbooks have been published and a variety of courses are being offered on the `social psychology of education', but no journal has hitherto appeared to cover the field. Social Psychology of Education fills this gap, covering a wide variety of content concerns, theoretical interests and research methods, among which are: Content concerns: classroom instruction decision making in education educational innovation concerns for gender, race, ethnicity and social class knowledge creation, transmission and effects leadership in schools and school systems long-term effects of instructional processes micropolitics of schools student cultures and interactions teacher recruitment and careers teacher- student relations.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational

It was formed in 2001 when the Society merged its two journals, the Journal of Reproduction and Fertility and Reviews of Reproduction. Reproduction publishes original research articles and topical reviews on the subject of reproductive and developmental biology, and reproductive medicine. The journal will consider publication of high-quality meta-analyses; these should be submitted to the research papers category. The journal considers studies in humans and all animal species, and will publish clinical studies if they advance our understanding of the underlying causes and/or mechanisms of disease. Scientific excellence and broad interest to our readership are the most important criteria during the peer review process. The journal publishes articles that make a clear advance in the field, whether of mechanistic, descriptive or technical focus. Articles that substantiate new or controversial reports are welcomed if they are noteworthy and advance the field. Topics include, but are not limited to, reproductive immunology, reproductive toxicology, stem cells, environmental effects on reproductive potential and health (eg obesity), extracellular vesicles, fertility preservation and epigenetic effects on reproductive and developmental processes.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell

Using diverse methodologies, Men and Masculinities's articles explore the evolving roles and perceptions of men across society. Complementing existing publications on women's studies and gay and lesbian studies, Men and Masculinities helps complete the spectrum of research on gender. The journal gives scholars interested in gender vital, balanced information on the burgeoning - and often misunderstood - field of masculinities studies. Research articles, review essays and book reviews keep you up to date on one of the most exciting and important fields of human inquiry today. As gender informs so many different areas of our lives, the study of men must be approached by many perspectives. Men and Masculinities provides a comprehensive, inclusive view on men's studies by maintaining international contributions from a wide range of relevant fields, including: sociology, psychology, media and communication studies, history, criminology and criminal justice, literature, anthropology, and ethnic studies. Men and Masculinities seek to publish groundbreaking empirical research and theoretical articles that look at all aspects of men and masculinity in society including: men's movements and mythopoetic approaches, fatherhood, male/female relationships, media representations of masculinity, male sexualities, sports, the work/family relationships, race and ethnicity, and

We are particularly interested in addressing policymakers in government and funding organizations who are thinking about gaps in scientific knowledge and want to encourage development of the sciences of mind, brain, and behavior in targeted directions.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100886228&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100886228\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
