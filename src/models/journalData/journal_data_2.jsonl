A large proportion of these deaths could be prevented, but improving prevention and treatment outcomes requires accurate diagnosis, the development of effective and precise treatment modalities and a better understanding of the socioeconomic factors that affect cancer incidence, prevalence and mortality. Nature Cancer aims to provide a unique forum through which the cancer community will learn about the latest, most significant cancer-related advances across the life, physical, applied and social sciences. Areas of interest include fundamental, preclinical research that furthers our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumour initiation, propagation and progression; work aiming to translate this knowledge to the clinic by focusing on new approaches for the development and delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities; clinical studies informing cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention; and new ways of understanding the global societal impact of cancer. In addition to publishing original research, Nature Cancer will publish Comments, Reviews, News & Views, Features and Correspondence of high significance across the range of disciplines relating to cancer research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101023100&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101023100\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
