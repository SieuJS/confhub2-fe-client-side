Original theoretical works, research reports, literature reviews, software reviews, book reviews and announcements are published. The journal addresses both the use of computers in psychology, psychiatry and related disciplines as well as the psychological impact of computer use on individuals, groups and society. The former category includes articles exploring the use of computers for professional practice, training, research and theory development. The latter category includes articles dealing with the psychological effects of computers on phenomena such as human development, learning, cognition, personality, and social interactions. The journal addresses human interactions with computers, not computers per se. The computer is discussed only as a medium through which human behaviors are shaped and expressed. The primary message of most articles involves information about human behavior. Therefore, professionals with an interest in the psychological aspects of computer use, but with limited knowledge of computers, will find this journal of interest.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Arts and Humanities

Radical shifts in journalism are changing every aspect of the production, content and reception of news; and at a dramatic pace which has transformed ‘new media’ into ‘legacy media’ in barely a decade. These crucial changes challenge traditional assumptions in journalism practice, scholarship and education, make definitional boundaries fluid and require reassessment of even the most fundamental questions such as \"What is journalism?\" and \"Who is a journalist?\" Digital Journalism pursues a significant and exciting editorial agenda including: Digital media and the future of journalism; Social media as sources and drivers of news; The changing ‘places’ and ‘spaces’ of news production and consumption in the context of digital media; News on the move and mobile telephony; The personalisation of news; Business models for funding digital journalism in the digital economy; Developments in data journalism and data visualisation; New research methods to analyse and explore digital journalism; Hyperlocalism and new understandings of community journalism; Changing relationships between journalists, sources and audiences; Citizen and participatory journalism; Machine written news and the automation of journalism; The history and evolution of online journalism; Changing journalism ethics in a digital setting; New challenges and directions for journalism education and training; Digital journalism, protest and democracy; Journalists’ changing role perceptions; Wikileaks and novel forms of investigative journalism.

Since its initiation in 1980, the editors have encouraged the broadest possible scope. The term `business' is understood in a wide sense to include all systems involved in the exchange of goods and services, while `ethics' is circumscribed as all human action aimed at securing a good life. Systems of production, consumption, marketing, advertising, social and economic accounting, labour relations, public relations and organisational behaviour are analysed from a moral viewpoint. The style and level of dialogue involve all who are interested in business ethics - the business community, universities, government agencies and consumer groups. Speculative philosophy as well as reports of empirical research are welcomed. In order to promote a dialogue between the various interested groups as much as possible, papers are presented in a style relatively free of specialist jargon.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Arts

Submissions to the Annals are broadly defined as follows: - Reviews – retrospective reviews, helping readers understand the development of current knowledge within the discipline over a defined period in the past, or prescriptive reviews, creating a roadmap for future direction of research on communication - Communication Insights – examining a set of predetermined topics that provide a degree of continuity across the years and indicate how a specific research topic has developed. A set of predetermined topics will rotate over five year periods - Book Reviews – reviewing a set of recently published books that focus on a central theme within the discipline. The goal of the Annals book reviews is to provide a critical review and synthesis of published books. The Editor encourages authors from non-English language speaking countries to consider submitting topical reviews of books not available in the English language in order to increase the reach of communication studies research globally. The Annals is both international and interdisciplinary in scope, with authors and chapters representing the broad global interests of the International Communication Association. All submissions will be subject to initial editor screening and subsequent peer review.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100916904&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100916904\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Launched in 1994 under the title Chemistry & Biology, the journal was the first to recognize the growing importance of investigations done at the interface of chemistry and biology, and its mission has always been to support and promote chemical biology and conversation and collaboration between chemical and life sciences. Cell Chemical Biology strongly encourages submission of articles that provide significant conceptual advancement of broad general interest to both chemists and biologists. We are especially interested in papers that combine the use of chemical tools to perturb, visualize, and measure biological systems and properties and offer unique insights into molecular mechanism or physiology. We also encourage submissions that are focused on method development for basic life sciences or that have practical impact of either clinical or biotechnological nature. Some additional types of research that we consider within our scope are studies of metabolism and physiology; enzyme mechanism and natural product biosynthesis; generation, distribution, and function of small molecule-protein conjugates such as post-translational modifications; mechanism of resistance to small molecules by viruses/bacteria/cancer cells/organisms; intra- and intercellular and intra- and interspecies communication mediated by small molecules; and chemical biology of lipids, sugars, and nucleic acids. Finally, large-scale studies enabled by the use of chemistry-based technology, such as proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and glycomics, are also within our scope, as well as synthetic and systems biology work when inspired and supported by chemical tools or aimed at engineering biological systems to perform a new type of chemical transformation.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical

The journal aims to promote the exploration of all fundamental issues underlying the creative tension among mathematics, computer science and application areas unencumbered by any external criteria such as the pressure for applications. The journal will thus serve an increasingly important and applicable area of mathematics. The journal hopes to further the understanding of the deep relationships between mathematical theory: analysis, topology, geometry and algebra, and the computational processes as they are evolving in tandem with the modern computer. With its distinguished editorial board selecting papers of the highest quality and interest from the international community, FoCM hopes to influence both mathematics and computation. Relevance to applications will not constitute a requirement for the publication of articles. The journal does not accept code for review however authors who have code/data related to the submission should include a weblink to the repository where the data/code is stored.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analysis","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied

First, because JPP&M publishes articles on current public policy issues, manuscripts that address topical problems are strongly encouraged. The focus of articles should be thoughtful and insightful analyses of public issues that affect the profession of marketing. Articles should be scholarly, practical, and well documented, and they should meet generally accepted standards for conceptual and analytical rigor appropriate for a premier professional journal. Recent issues addressed in the journal have included consumer privacy, product warnings, deregulation, the role of the FTC and the state in regulating marketing and advertising, health care, pricing, international trade, and vulnerable populations. Second, JPP&M encourages the submission of manuscripts that advance theory development or research methods in the field. For example, manuscripts that focus on understanding consumers' processing of warning messages, developing methods for clustering products into relevant markets for antitrust analysis, or providing ethical foundations of appropriate marketing activity are suitable for publication. Stimulating Interest in Marketing and Public Policy Research JPP&M endeavors to inform its readers about ongoing public policy debates. Therefore, the journal encourages the submission of thoughtful statements on current controversies as a means of influencing the direction of further research. JPP&M also encourages young scholars to submit manuscripts on marketing and public policy topics. The journal will continue to play a significant role in helping emerging scholars develop their research programs.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International

In Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, we help the reader by providing in a systematic manner: 1. The views of experts on current advances in environmental sustainability in a clear and readable form. 2. Evaluations of the most interesting papers, annotated by experts, from the great wealth of original publications. Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability aims to track the emergence of a new innovative sustainability science discipline by integrating across regional and global systems with their typical dimensions, human-environment interactions and management challenges. Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability thus emphasises the actual interdisciplinary sustainability research approaches, the solutions it provides and their dissemination and application. The subject of environmental sustainability is divided into 6 themed annual issues. Each theme helps to identify, understand and solve sustainability problems and are not mutually exclusive. The overlap results from the actual complexity of combining all the sustainability science dimensions and approaches. The themes are: 1. Environmental change issues; 2. Environmental change assessments; 3. System dynamics and sustainability; 4. Sustainability governance and transformation; 5. Sustainability challenges; 6. Sustainability science.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19400158343&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19400158343\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
