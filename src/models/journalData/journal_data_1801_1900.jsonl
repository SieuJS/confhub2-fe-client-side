The journal focuses on genetic, neurobiological, immunological, epidemiological and psychological mechanisms and how these influence developmental processes in ASD. The journal encourages the submission of original research papers (Research Articles and Short Reports) that take a developmental approach to the biology and psychology of autism, with a particular emphasis on identifying underlying mechanisms and integrating across different levels of analysis. Contributions are typically empirical, but the journal also publishes theoretical papers if they significantly advance thinking. The journal encourages papers reporting work on animals or cell or other model systems that are directly relevant to a better understanding of ASD. The journal also publishes reports of carefully conducted clinical trials of treatments for the core symptoms or one of the common co-morbid symptoms of ASD. Papers presenting clinical trials will be judged, in part, on whether there is an empirical justification for the reported treatment. Individuals included in research studies can span the full spectrum of ASD, including the broader phenotype, and there are no restrictions on study participants in terms of age or intellectual ability.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17300154985&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17300154985\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The subject matter is focused on including evolutionary biology, zoogeography, taxonomy, including biochemical taxonomy and stock identification, genetics and genetic manipulation, physiology, functional morphology, behavior, ecology, fisheries assessment, development, exploitation and conservation. The journal also publishes reviews from any field of fish biology where the emphasis is placed on adaptation, function or exploitation in the whole organism. The aims of published reviews are first, to provide an up-to-date synopsis for research workers in the chosen field with an outline of the next problems which should be tackled, and secondly, to furnish the non-specialist fish biologist with an awareness and understanding of the field. In addition to original and review articles, Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries includes details of interesting papers given at recent conferences, book reviews and correspondence arising from the reviews. The Journal caters for all those with an interest in fish biology and fisheries including those from universities and research institutes, fishing industries, local, regional and government institutions and international organizations.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23366&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23366\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers may address a variety of topics but the link with learning and managing organizations must be made explicit. Papers on specific topics which do not consider implications for learning would not be appropriate. Manuscripts drawing on field research may involve a wide variety of data sources and research methods, including ethnographic, discursive, deconstructive, narrative, survey and case study methodologies. The common theme is that contributions are written with the readership of Management Learning in mind a readership that expects high quality, thought-provoking, innovative, thoughtful papers that make a clear contribution to the field. Management Learning includes work on topics relating to: Learning and knowing in management and organizations: including individual and organizational learning; critical and reflexive approaches to learning, managing and organizing. Processes and practices of learning: for example, different approaches and new perspectives on learning and pedagogy, critical approaches to management education; relationships between learning and experience; formal and informal learning; and the roles of language, symbols, narratives and metaphor in learning and knowing. Theoretical perspectives on learning and knowing: for example, philosophies of knowledge and knowing and conceptual approaches to learning and development. Wider issues: for example, the relationship between learning and culture, gender, ethics, power, and emotion; and critiquing conventional approaches to management learning.

We accomplish this aim by appointing international authorities to serve as Section Editors in key subject areas, such as antiretroviral therapies, behavioral aspects of management, and metabolic complications and comorbidity.

Readers include life and computational scientists, who can take the important findings presented here to the next level of discovery. Research articles must be declared as belonging to a relevant section. More information about the sections can be found in the submission guidelines. Research articles should model aspects of biological systems, demonstrate both methodological and scientific novelty, and provide profound new biological insights. Generally, reliability and significance of biological discovery through computation should be validated and enriched by experimental studies. Inclusion of experimental validation is not required for publication, but should be referenced where possible. Inclusion of experimental validation of a modest biological discovery through computation does not render a manuscript suitable for PLOS Computational Biology. Research articles specifically designated as Methods papers should describe outstanding methods of exceptional importance that have been shown, or have the promise to provide new biological insights. The method must already be widely adopted, or have the promise of wide adoption by a broad community of users. Enhancements to existing published methods will only be considered if those enhancements bring exceptional new capabilities.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular

Dialogues is theoretical in orientation, forward looking, and seeks to publish original and innovative work that pushes the boundaries of geographical theory, praxis and pedagogy through a unique (in Geography) and innovative format of open peer commentary. This format strongly encourages engaged dialogue. The scope of the journal is both the broad agenda of human geography as a whole (and in relation to the social sciences, humanities, and environmental sciences more generally) and specific ideas, debates, and modes of praxis within disciplinary sub-fields.

Original contributions providing insight into the use of analytical, computational (e.g. FEM, BEM, mesh-free methods and others) modelling methods for rigid-body mechanics (e.g. dynamics, vibration, stability), structural mechanics, metal forming, behaviour and application of advanced materials (metals, composite, cellular, smart etc.), impact mechanics, strain localization and other effects of nonlinearity (e.g. large deflections, plasticity, fracture etc.), fluid mechanics (external and internal flows), tribology, thermodynamics and materials processing generally form the core of the journal contents. The International Journal of Mechanical Sciences does not accept for publication material which quite specifically belongs with other established specialist journals. Papers whose concern is primarily with mathematical or computational techniques, developed within a general framework and not aimed at any specific engineering application, are not requested. Similarly, papers whose content is purely descriptive or empirical and which do not make any scientific contribution, will not be considered. Comparison with experiments/tests conducted by the authors or others to validate the main contribution of the paper are strongly encouraged, however design-based studies, based on established formulae

Population Health Metrics covers a broad range of topics encompassing health state measurement and valuation, summary measures of population health, descriptive epidemiology at the population level, burden of disease and injury analysis, disease and risk factor modeling for populations, and comparative assessment of risks to health at the population level. The journal is also interested in how to use and communicate indicators of population health to reduce disease burden, and the approaches for translating from indicators of population health to health-advancing actions. As a cross-cutting topic of importance, we are particularly interested in inequalities in population health and their measurement.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=22494&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=22494\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal eschews adherence to any particular school or approach, nor is it either predisposed or restricted to any particular methodology. Theoretically aware empirical analysis and conceptual innovation forms the core of the journal’s dissemination of International Relations scholarship throughout the global academic community. In keeping with its European roots, this includes a commitment to underlying philosophical and normative issues relevant to the field, as well as interaction with related disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This theoretical and methodological openness aims to produce a European journal with global impact, fostering broad awareness and innovation in a dynamic discipline. Adherence to this broad mandate has underpinned the journal’s emergence as a major and independent worldwide voice across the sub-fields of International Relations scholarship. The Editors embrace and are committed to further developing this inheritance. Above all the journal aims to achieve a representative balance across the diversity of the field and to promote deeper understanding of the rapidly-changing world around us. This includes an active and on-going commitment to facilitating dialogue with the study of global politics in the social sciences and beyond, among others international history, international law, international and development economics, and political/economic geography.

The goal is to provide a natural home for a significant body of current research, and a useful forum for ideas on future studies in randomness. Results concerning random graphs, hypergraphs, matroids, trees, mappings, permutations, matrices, sets and orders, as well as stochastic graph processes and networks are presented with particular emphasis on the use of probabilistic methods in combinatorics as developed by Paul Erdõs. The journal focuses on probabilistic algorithms, average case analysis of deterministic algorithms, and applications of probabilistic methods to cryptography, data structures, searching and sorting. The journal also devotes space to such areas of probability theory as percolation, random walks and combinatorial aspects of probability.

With a cutting edge approach to linking theoretical development and empirical research, and a consistent demand for quality, IJURR encompasses key material from an unparalleled range of critical, comparative and geographic perspectives. Embracing a multidisciplinary approach to the field, IJURR is essential reading for social scientists with a concern for the complex, changing roles and futures of cities and regions. Debates: The Debates section of IJURR presents shorter, sometimes contentious papers on recent developments in the field --- policy, practice and theory --- and occasional coverage of truly groundbreaking convocations, mobilizations and reports. This section aims to create a space for provocation, critical reflection, heuristic propositions and initial reports on the use of new methodologies. It also features debates centered on articles published in this journal that have prompted controversy, conceptual breakthroughs and strong opinion among IJURR's readership. Symposia: An IJURR symposium is expected to present a coherent and well-grounded (both empirically and conceptually) collection of articles. With the aim of bringing fresh perspectives and insights to urban and regional debates, symposia comprise a minimum of three and a maximum of six articles, allowing for an in-depth and comparative exploration of an important urban theme or concept. A symposium proposal must be submitted in the first instance for consideration by the editors. Symposium proposals will be considered only if they adhere to the symposium proposal guidelines, available here. Book Reviews: IJURRs review section provides an informed, critical overview of the most important new publications and relevant, less obvious books that should not be overlooked. Spanning a wide subject and geographic area, this section is a reliable and valuable resource for researchers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology
