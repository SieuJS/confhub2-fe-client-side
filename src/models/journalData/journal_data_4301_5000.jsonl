As reflected by the journal’s title, the Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice is devoted to advancing the field of marketing in meaningful ways through scholarship that is both rigorous and relevant. The Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice was the first high quality general marketing journal to require the pairing of academic sensibilities toward research with high potential for application of findings “on Monday morning” by marketing practitioners. The journal provides a unique outlet for publishing managerially relevant articles across a broad range of marketing subjects – an alternative to the fragmentation of the field of marketing into many sub-disciplines each represented by a specialty journal. With a decidedly international inclusiveness in terms of authors and reviewers, the Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice values and publishes both conceptual (non-empirical) and empirical work. The journal is also unbiased in preference to methodologies employed in empirical papers so long as the methodological approach properly fits the study’s aims and research questions.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Marketing","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5000153402&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5000153402\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

IJEDRO is an open access, peer-reviewed journal which draws contributions from a wide community of international and interdisciplinary researchers across the field of educational research. We seek contributions that present innovative application of theories, conceptual frameworks and research methodologies, and which inform research, policy and practice beyond the context in which the original work is undertaken. The International Journal of Educational Research Open so so-named to reflect our international facing publication portfolio and readership. Contributions do not need to be comparative (in the sense of comparing aspects of education in different countries or cultures) or report research carried out in just one location or cultural setting. However, contributions to the International Journal of Educational Research Open need to be thought-provoking, contribute to the educational research field, and inspire international, interdisciplinary readership. Therefore, contributions must have the following features: • Clear communication about the research findings or arguments • Critical demonstration of how the literature critically relates to the topic researched • Strong theoretical, conceptual or philosophical framing • Clearly explained design and analysis, allowing replication of the study in other (international) contexts • Critical analysis, recommendations and implications for further research, policy and practice in an international context","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101092873&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101092873\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Not only does that include Keynesian ideas about macroeconomic theory and policy, it also extends to microeconomic and meso-economic analysis and relevant empirical and historical research. The journal provides a forum for developing and disseminating Keynesian ideas, and intends to encourage critical exchange with other macroeconomic paradigms. The journal is dedicated to the development of Keynesian theory and policy. In our view, Keynesian theory should hold a similar place in economics to that held by the theory of evolution in biology. Many individual economists still work within the Keynesian paradigm, but intellectual success demands institutional support that can leverage those individual efforts. The journal offers such support by providing a forum for developing and sharing Keynesian ideas. Not only does that include ideas about macroeconomic theory and policy, it also extends to microeconomic and meso-economic analysis and relevant empirical and historical research. We see a bright future for the Keynesian approach to macroeconomics and invite the economics profession to join us by subscribing to the journal and submitting manuscripts.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100406328&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100406328\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers can be accepted from all species if they are in, or contribute knowledge to, animal production systems. Animal is essential reading for all animal scientists, stakeholders and policy makers interested in agricultural, biomedical, veterinary and environmental sciences with expected impacts on Animal Production and Productivity, Animal Welfare, Animal Health, Food Security, Environment, Climate Change, Product Quality, Human Health and Nutrition, and Sustainability of Animal Agriculture and Livestock Systems. Impacts should be of international relevance. Animal aims to publish novel and original research papers, horizon-scanning reviews and critically informative opinion papers. Papers should consider animal responses, as well as lower or upper levels of understanding, with research spanning from genes to systems. Interactions between levels of approach are encouraged to account for the integrative nature of biological systems. The main subject areas include: breeding and genetics; nutrition (monogastrics, ruminants); physiology and functional biology; welfare, behaviour and health management (welfare and behaviour; health management); livestock farming systems (livestock systems; precision livestock farming); quality of animal products.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5300152613&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5300152613\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The theory of fuzzy sets now encompasses a well organized corpus of basic notions including (and not restricted to) aggregation operations, a generalized theory of relations, specific measures of information content, a calculus of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy sets are also the cornerstone of a non-additive uncertainty theory, namely possibility theory, and of a versatile tool for both linguistic and numerical modeling: fuzzy rule-based systems. Numerous works now combine fuzzy concepts with other scientific disciplines as well as modern technologies. In mathematics fuzzy sets have triggered new research topics in connection with category theory, topology, algebra, analysis. Fuzzy sets are also part of a recent trend in the study of generalized measures and integrals, and are combined with statistical methods. Furthermore, fuzzy sets have strong logical underpinnings in the tradition of many-valued logics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Logic","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=26529&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=26529\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Climate Services brings science and practice closer together. The journal addresses both researchers in the field of climate service research, and stakeholders and practitioners interested in or already applying climate services. It serves as a means of communication, dialogue and exchange between researchers and stakeholders. Climate services pioneers novel research areas that directly refer to how climate information can be applied in methodologies and tools for adaptation to climate change. It publishes best practice examples, case studies as well as theories, methods and data analysis with a clear connection to climate services. The focus of the published work is often multi-disciplinary, case-specific, tailored to specific sectors and strongly application-oriented.

The journal also publishes research aimed at developing and testing of models of cognitive processing or behavior in applied situations, including laboratory and field settings. Occasionally, review articles are considered for publication if they contribute significantly to important topics within applied experimental psychology. Areas of interest include applications of perception, attention, memory, decision making, reasoning, information processing, problem solving, learning, and skill acquisition. Settings may be industrial (such as human-computer interface design), academic (such as intelligent computer-aided instruction), forensic (such as eyewitness memory), or consumer oriented (such as product instructions).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15476&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15476\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Its subject matter is the evaluation of activities concerned with scientific research, technological development and innovation. This covers a very broad range of potential topics. The evaluation subjects can range from individuals, through research funding or performing organisations, up to inter-country comparisons of research and innovation performance, from single research projects to complex policy interventions. We cover public and private sectors, natural and life sciences as well as social sciences and humanities. The term 'evaluation' applies to all policy stages from priority setting and proposals, through the monitoring of on-going projects and programmes, the ex-post assessment of their outputs and outcomes, and the integration of evaluation results into policy. Papers on methods are also welcome. Research Evaluation is not committed to any specific approach or philosophy, quantitative, qualitative or otherwise.

Born in 1998 as Cuadernos de Economía y Dirección de la Empresa (CEDE), it soon became the leading management publication in Spanish thanks to its strong academic reputation. The journal was indexed in the SCCI in 2008, and it has been published in English under the new title since 2014. Business Research Quarterly (BRQ) is a pear reviewed, Open Access journal which provides widespread coverage of high quality research in a broad range of topics such as human resource management, organization theory, strategic management, corporate governance, managerial economics, marketing, finance, accounting and operations management.

It provides a forum for original translational research on using systems neuroscience findings to improve educational outcome, as well as for reviews on basic and applied research relevant to education. Just as 200 years ago, medicine was little more than a mixture of bits of knowledge, fads and plain quackery without a basic grounding in a scientific understanding of the body, and just as in the middle of the nineteenth century, Hermann von Helmholtz, Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke, Emil Du Bois-Reymond and a few others got together and drew up a scheme for what medicine should be (i.e., applied natural science), we believe that this can be taken as a model for what should happen in the field of education. In many countries, education is merely the field of ideology, even though we know that how children learn is not a question of left or right political orientation.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100228128&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100228128\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

As well as exploring thematic areas where these techniques and protocols are being used, articles review the impact that these approaches have had, or are likely to have, on their field. Subjects covered by the Journal include but are not restricted to: the identification and functional characterisation of coding and non-coding features in genomes, microarray technologies, gene expression profiling, next generation sequencing, pharmacogenomics, phenomics, SNP technologies, transgenic systems, mutation screens and genotyping. Articles range in scope and depth from the introductory level to specific details of protocols and analyses, encompassing bacterial, fungal, plant, animal and human data. The editorial board welcome the submission of review articles for publication. Essential criteria for the publication of papers is that they do not contain primary data, and that they are high quality, clearly written review articles which provide a balanced, highly informative and up to date perspective to researchers in the field of functional genomics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine

In addition to the traditional issues and problems in numerical analysis, the journal also publishes papers describing relevant applications in such fields as physics, fluid dynamics, engineering and other branches of applied science with a computational mathematics component. The journal strives to be flexible in the type of papers it publishes and their format. Equally desirable are: (i) Full papers, which should be complete and relatively self-contained original contributions with an introduction that can be understood by the broad computational mathematics community. Both rigorous and heuristic styles are acceptable. Of particular interest are papers about new areas of research, in which other than strictly mathematical arguments may be important in establishing a basis for further developments. (ii) Tutorial review papers, covering some of the important issues in Numerical Mathematics, Scientific Computing and their Applications. The journal will occasionally publish contributions which are larger than the usual format for regular papers. (iii) Short notes, which present specific new results and techniques in a brief communication.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied

The price we pay for these riches is the deterioration in our health and the emergence of disabling and killer diseases, many of which are of our own making. The journal adopts an inter-disciplinary approach to the problem of managing the environment and up-keeping good quality standards, with a view to reducing the deleterious effects of man's activities By analyzing ways in which industrial and agricultural bodies can take preventative and remedial action to reduce pollution and the use of chemicals and eliminate the problem of hazardous waste products-in other words, managing our environment responsibly – the journal presents major research findings, warnings of potential dangers to health, and suggestions for different codes of practice to safeguard our environment and health. It also encourages international liaison, assessment, and co-operation. Authors are invited to submit papers from the following areas: • Environmental protection • Nutrition • Agriculture • Transport • Pollution control • Radioactive waste • Stress and disease • Toxic

Continuing our strong tradition in this area, Themed Issues are also warmly encouraged. To further stimulate debate, we also invite the submission of theoretical 'position papers' (opinion pieces) that present novel theoretical perspectives on either established or novel phenomena of relevance to the psychology of language. These papers may be used to package together into a single article a theoretical position that has evolved across a number of prior publications. Alternatively, they may be used to present novel ideas that have not been expressed elsewhere.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cognitive

With the expansion of the intercultural communication and language services provision sectors has come a proliferation of training programmes in the field. ITT has been, since its inception in 2007, the first and only journal in the field of translation and interpreting studies to specialize in training-related issues. ITT welcomes contributions from diverse theoretical and applied approaches among trainers, educators, researchers and all associated professionals, with the aim of exchanging and enriching skills and knowledge in the professional translator and interpreter communities and amongst trainers themselves. The journal encourages critical reflection on: curricular design; syllabus design; translator and translation competence(s); interpreter and interpreting competence(s); teaching and learning approaches; resources (including ICT), methods and techniques; assessment and accreditation; trainer training. It seeks in particular to encourage interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate appropriate research methods and insights from fields such as (higher) education, curricular studies and language acquisition, as well as others more frequently associated with translation and interpreting studies, such as cultural studies, linguistics, communication studies, anthropology, cognitive science and literary studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12100156346&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12100156346\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal addresses issues dealing with psychological and physical health and interpersonal losses relative to extended family, community life, and society as a whole. In order to broaden the reader’s perspective on loss and bereavement, the journal defines loss as a major reduction in a person’s resources, whether personal, material, or symbolic, to which the person was emotionally attached. Types of loss covered include: death and dying; dissolution and divorce; loss of employment; life-threatening diseases and long-term disability; loss of possessions; homelessness; recurring and haunting memories; disenfranchisement and stigmatization; losses resulting from war and violence; and aging. The Journal of Loss & Trauma highlights common as well as differing impacts of major losses while revealing commonalities of the various healing processes. Interdisciplinary in its approach, the journal publishes empirically-oriented papers, case studies with intervention strategies, point-counterpoint discussions, theoretical analyses, essays on concepts or links among relevant fields, and therapeutic approaches. Book reviews are also regular features.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental

Special emphasis is placed on the practice and evolution of assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) with reference to the diagnosis and management of diseases affecting fertility. Our goal is to educate our readership in the translation of basic and clinical discoveries made from human or relevant animal models to the safe and efficacious practice of human ARTs. The scientific rigor and ethical standards embraced by the JARG editorial team ensures a broad international base of expertise guiding the marriage of contemporary clinical research paradigms with basic science discovery. JARG publishes original papers, minireviews, case reports, and opinion pieces often combined into special topic issues that will educate clinicians and scientists with interests in the mechanisms of human development that bear on the treatment of infertility and emerging innovations in human ARTs. The guiding principles of male and female reproductive health impacting pre- and post-conceptional viability and developmental potential are emphasized within the purview of human reproductive health in current and future generations of our species.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental

Papers encompass a large variety of issues, populations, and domains, including homicide (serial, spree, and mass murder: sexual homicide), sexual deviance and assault (rape, serial rape, child molestation, paraphilias), child and youth violence (firesetting, gang violence, juvenile sexual offending), family violence (child physical and sexual abuse, child neglect, incest, spouse and elder abuse), genetic predispositions, and the physiological basis of aggression. Manuscripts that articulate disparate orientations will be welcomed, given that this journal will be cross-disciplinary and cross-theoretical. Indeed, papers will emanate from numerous disciplines, psychology, psychiatry, criminology, criminal justice, law, sociology, anthropology, genetics, social work, ethology, and physiology. Papers describing the study of aggression in normal, criminal, and psychopathological populations are acceptable. Reviews of analog investigations of aggression and animal models will be considered if the contribution is likely to lead to significant movement in the field. The emphasis, however, will be on innovativeness of presentation and clarity of thinking.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical

Topics include: Theory, implementation and performance evaluation of algorithms and computer codes for linear, nonlinear, discrete, stochastic optimization and optimal control. This includes in particular conic, semi-definite, mixed integer, network, non-smooth, multi-objective and global optimization by deterministic or nondeterministic algorithms. Algorithms and software for complementarity, variational inequalities and equilibrium problems, and also for solving inverse problems, systems of nonlinear equations and the numerical study of parameter dependent operators. Various aspects of efficient and user-friendly implementations: e.g. automatic differentiation, massively parallel optimization, distributed computing, on-line algorithms, error sensitivity and validity analysis, problem scaling, stopping criteria and symbolic numeric interfaces. Theoretical studies with clear potential for applications and successful applications of specially adapted optimization methods and software to fields like engineering, machine learning, data mining, economics, finance, biology, or medicine. These submissions should not consist solely of the straightforward use of standard optimization techniques.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28538&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=28538\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal aims to provide a bridge between different strands of literature and different contributions of economic theory and empirical economics. This bridge is built in two ways. First, by encouraging empirical research (including case studies, econometric work and historical research), evaluating existing economic theory, and suggesting appropriate directions for future effort in theoretical work. Second, by exploring ways of applying and testing existing areas of theory to the economics of innovation and new technology, and ways of using theoretical insights to inform data collection and other empirical research. The journal welcomes contributions across a wide range of issues concerned with innovation, including: the generation of new technological knowledge, innovation in product markets, process innovation, patenting, adoption, diffusion, innovation and technology policy, international competitiveness, standardization and network externalities, innovation and growth, technology transfer, innovation and market structure, innovation and the environment, and across a broad range of economic activity not just in ‘high technology’ areas. The journal is open to a variety of methodological approaches ranging from case studies to econometric exercises with sound theoretical modelling, empirical evidence both longitudinal and cross-sectional about technologies, regions, firms, industries and countries.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management of Technology and Innovation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=10600153365&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=10600153365\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

MycoKeys will publish papers on the monophyletic kingdom Fungi containing taxonomic or ecological data on any taxon of any geological age from any part of the world with no limit to manuscript size. MycoKeys will consider for publishing works on the following topics: -descriptions of new taxa, if they are accompanied with proper diagnoses and/or keys to distinguish them from close relatives or similar taxa, and if DNA sequence data are deposited in Genbank prior to publication (few possible exceptions from this rule are listed inthe section Taxonomic Treatments). All new taxa need to be registered at Mycobank and the registration numbers indicated in the manuscript. New taxa should ideally be described in connection with a phylogenetic analysis or evidence that the barcode gene (ITS) is unique for the new taxon. -taxonomic revisions of extant (or ''recent'') and fossil fungal groups -checklists and catalogues -phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses, if alignments are deposited in TreeBase (with accession number listed in the text). -papers in descriptive and/or historical biogeography -methodology papers, including description of new software, if released a open source license and released as supplementary material to the article. -data mining and literature surveys -monographs, conspecti, atlases -primer notes -\"Points of View\" commentaries -collections of papers, Festschrift volumes, conference proceedings -data papers (datesets published as supplementary files and through the GBIF or Barcode of Life infrastructures","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100414384&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100414384\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Its mission is to adhere to the multidisciplinary paradigm of the 21st century, fostering a strong connection between radiology in the experimental setting and basic science. Research on phantom studies, cell models and radiobiology, animal models, new modalities/techniques (e.g., MR sequences or spectral CT applications, molecular, hybrid, and optical imaging), novel contrast materials, tracers, and probes are welcome. Other topics fully considered are: 3D-modelling, printing, and simulation; advanced teleradiology (e.g., virtual physician-patient interaction); novel image reconstruction algorithms and post-processing. Studies on humans are also suitable for publication, especially if they are proof of concept or explorative studies, concern computer-assisted detection/diagnosis, data extraction for risk stratification or prognosis, or innovative approaches to clinical study design. Manuscripts reporting innovation for interventional radiology, imaging biomarkers, radiogenomics, or new clinical decision support systems are also welcome. The goal of the journal is to provide a forum open not only to radiologists, nuclear physicians, or radiation therapists but also to other professionals such as physicists, biologists, chemists, bioengineers, and biomathematicians, experts in computer science, information technology, and bioinformatics, as well physicians working in medical imaging from other medical specialties such as pathologists, geneticists, neurologists, surgeons, cardiologists, and many more.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100904743&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100904743\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

A phenomenon not linked downscale is merely descriptive; an observation not linked upscale, might be trivial. Physiologists often refer qualitatively to processes at finer or coarser scale than the scale of their observation, and studies formally directed at three, or even two adjacent scales are rare.

In recent years, however, the cost of developing new drugs has soared, and concerns over drug resistance and pharmacoeconomics have come to the fore. Adverse reactions experienced at the clinical trial level serve as a constant reminder of the importance of rigorous safety and toxicity testing. Furthermore the advent of pharmacogenomics and ‘individualized’ approaches to therapy will demand a fresh approach to drug evaluation and healthcare delivery. Clinical Pharmacology provides an essential role in integrating the expertise of all of the specialists and players who are active in meeting such challenges in modern biomedical practice.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology (medical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=10300153301&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=10300153301\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Vascular disease is the commonest cause of death in Westernized countries and its incidence is on the increase in developing countries. It follows that considerable research is directed at establishing effective treatment for acute vascular events. Long-term treatment has also received considerable attention (e.g. for symptomatic relief). Furthermore, effective prevention, whether primary or secondary, is backed by the findings of several landmark trials. Vascular disease is a complex field with primary care physicians and nurse practitioners as well as several specialties involved. The latter include cardiology, vascular and cardio thoracic surgery, general medicine, radiology, clinical pharmacology and neurology (stroke units).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23155&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23155\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Studies describing the impact of pathogenic mutations in genes encoding components of contractile structures in humans or animals are welcome, provided they offer mechanistic insight into the disease process or the underlying gene function. The policy of the Journal is to encourage any form of novel practical study whatever its specialist interest, as long as it falls within this broad field. Theoretical essays are welcome provided that they are concise and suggest practical ways in which they may be tested. Manuscripts reporting new mutations in known disease genes without validation and mechanistic insight will not be considered. It is the policy of the journal that cells lines, hybridomas and DNA clones should be made available by the developers to any qualified investigator. Submission of a manuscript for publication constitutes an agreement of the authors to abide by this principle.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12220&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12220\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The international range of authors and breadth of coverage allow the journal to forge links between many different areas of research including psychology, linguistics, cognitive science and anthropology. This interdisciplinary approach spans a wide range of interests: phonology, phonetics, morphology, syntax, vocabulary, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and any other recognised facet of language study. Aspects of reading development are considered when there is a clear language component. The journal normally publishes full-length empirical studies or General Articles as well as shorter Brief Research Reports. To be appropriate for this journal, articles should include some quantitative data analyses, and articles based on case studies need to have a convincing rationale for this design. The journal publishes thematic special issues on occasion, the topic and format of which are determined by the editorial team.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental and Educational

The Law Review publishes six issues a year: April, May, June, October, November, and December. We seek innovative ideas on a range of academic subject areas that boldly address the challenges we face today. The Law Review has two principal aims: produce scholarship that shapes the rule of law, and train future leaders of the legal profession. Our contribution is not simply to publish scholarship that remains in the academy; we strive to elevate ideas and arguments that impact the law and society. We believe this commitment to public service includes training our members to become prominent legal minds and social leaders.

The Israel Journal of Chemistry is the official journal of the Israel Chemical Society. Effective from Volume 50 (2010) it is published by Wiley-VCH. The Israel Journal of Chemistry is an international and peer-reviewed publication forum for Special Issues on timely research topics in all fields of chemistry: from biochemistry through organic and inorganic chemistry to polymer, physical and theoretical chemistry, including all interdisciplinary topics. Each topical issue is edited by one or several Guest Editors and primarily contains invited Review articles.

Founded in Europe and edited from the Netherlands and the UK, the journal has a broad-ranging view of cultural studies, charting new questions and new research, and mapping the transformation of cultural studies to come. The common denominator for the work published is in engagement with and a critical take on how power relations are (re)produced in everyday practices of meaning making. They might concern gender, class, race and ethnicity, sexuality, sexual preference, disability and other macro or micro sites of political struggle. The topics covered by European Journal of Cultural Studies cover a wide range. This is a result of our double focus on relations of power and processes of meaning making as the twin sides to how ‘culture’ is produced. Topic areas include (among others): popular cultural forms and practices; music; consumer cultures; media, film and television culture; post-colonial criticism; cultural policy; citizenship, sexualities, youth culture and class relations; intersectional constructions of identity; populism; creative industries.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Arts and Humanities

Gerontology, the oldest journal in the field, is also the only journal that responds to this need by drawing topical contributions from multiple disciplines to support the fundamental goals of extending active life and enhancing its quality. The range of papers is classified into five sections. In the Clinical Section, the aetiology, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of age-related diseases are discussed from a gerontological rather than a geriatric viewpoint. The Experimental Section contains up-to-date contributions from basic gerontological research. Papers dealing with behavioural development and related topics are placed in the Behavioural Science Section. Basic aspects of regeneration in different experimental biological systems as well as in the context of medical applications are dealt with in the Regenerative Section whereas the Technological Section contains important information on major technological advances for older adults. Providing a primary source of high-quality papers covering all aspects of aging in humans and animals, Gerontology serves as an ideal information tool for all readers interested in the topic of aging from a broad perspective.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aging","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Aging","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29071&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29071\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

These focus on questions relating to the nature of nursing and to the phenomena of key relevance to it. For example, any understanding of what nursing is presupposes some conception of just what nurses are trying to do when they nurse. But what are the ends of nursing? Are they to promote health, prevent disease, promote well-being, enhance autonomy, relieve suffering, or some combination of these? How are these ends are to be met? What kind of knowledge is needed in order to nurse? Practical, theoretical, aesthetic, moral, political, 'intuitive' or some other? Papers that explore other aspects of philosophical enquiry and analysis of relevance to nursing (and any other healthcare or social care activity) are also welcome and might include, but not be limited to, critical discussions of the work of nurse theorists who have advanced philosophical claims (e.g., Benner, Benner and Wrubel, Carper, Schrok, Watson, Parse and so on) as well as critical engagement with philosophers (e.g., Heidegger, Husserl, Kuhn, Polanyi, Taylor, MacIntyre and so on) whose work informs health care in general and nursing in particular.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Issues, Ethics and Legal Aspects","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Issues, Ethics and Legal

The bimonthly English journal strives to cover all branches of geology and related technology in the exploration and utilization of earth resources, namely, geology, petrology, mineralogy, ore deposit geology, tectonics, paleontology, stratigraphy, sedimentology, geochemistry, geophysics, environmental sciences, etc. Submissions of original articles in English from scientists both in China and around the World on relevant subjects are welcome. All articles are reviewed by two or more referees for scholarly presentation, technical merit, quality of scientific content, and utility of the results for practicing geologists. The Editorial Committee reserves the final decision concerning the acceptance of a paper. Articles should discuss new theories, methods and discoveries, recent achievements in the geosciences, as well as timely reviews on selected subjects. Articles should contain original data and facts which support the conclusions. Manuscripts should conform to the guidelines in the instructions for authors. The Editorial Committee of the journal has come to the decision that for the future development the journal should grow into an international scope to attract the best research papers, also internationally. Therefore starting with the first issue of 2009, the journal will be named Journal of Earth Science. We hope that this move will pay off very soon and that our authors and readers will help us to spread this good news to attract authors from all over the world.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19200157056&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19200157056\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Increasingly climate research is focused on the complexity of processes and responses across trophic webs and networks, highlighting how individual species' response to climate change effects its ecological system. As modeling has grown increasingly sophisticated, data from multiple actors in ecological networks leads to a fuller picture of the nonlinear dynamics of ecosystem processes and also to a clearer understanding of predictive challenges. The scope of the journal will include issues like range shifts/invasions, novel ecological communities, ecophysiology (drought, wildfires, etc) and phenology (migration, reproduction, and asynchronicity), and a wide range of methodological approaches to describing spatial and temporal complexity will be encouraged. Climate Change Ecology will promote a holistic view of understanding ecological responses to a rapidly changing world. Paper Types will include Research Articles, Review Articles, Perspectives, Case Studies/Short Communications, and Policy Analysis.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecological Modeling","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecological Modeling","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecological Modeling","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101097218&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101097218\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We publish high quality peer-reviewed articles that cover a wide range of topics including structure and functions of the diverse and complex tissue barriers that occur across tissue and cell types, including the molecular composition and dynamics of polarized cell junctions and cell-cell interactions during normal homeostasis, injury and disease state. Tissue barrier formation in regenerative medicine and restoration of tissue and organ function is also of interest. Tissue Barriers publishes several categories of articles including: Original Research Papers, Short Communications, Technical Papers, Reviews, Perspectives and Commentaries, Hypothesis and Meeting Reports. Reviews and Perspectives/Commentaries will typically be invited. We also anticipate to publish special issues that are devoted to rapidly developing or controversial areas of research. Suggestions for topics are welcome. Tissue Barriers objectives: Promote interdisciplinary awareness and collaboration between researchers working with epithelial, epidermal and endothelial barriers and to build a broad and cohesive worldwide community of scientists interesting in this exciting field. Comprehend the enormous complexity of tissue barriers and map cross-talks and interactions between their different cellular and non-cellular components. Highlight the roles of tissue barrier dysfunctions in human diseases. Promote understanding and strategies for restoration of tissue barrier formation and function in regenerative medicine. Accelerate a search for pharmacological enhancers of tissue barriers as potential therapeutic agents. Understand and optimize drug delivery across epithelial and endothelial barriers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100467801&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100467801\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Priority is given to innovative reports describing applications of advanced magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Novel studies employing other neuroimaging methods may be considered on a case by case basis, especially if coupled with MRI or PET. Examples of particularly relevant types of studies include the use of brain imaging for identification of at-risk populations, diagnosis and treatment planning, and for monitoring the effects of behavioral, pharmacological, and neurosurgical interventions. Novel research on individual differences in representation of normal functions will also be considered in the context of large well-powered studies. Studies bridging the higher cognitive and molecular levels of analysis are particularly welcome including, for example, research relating genetic polymorphisms and other biomarkers to brain structure, function or treatment-induced changes. Translational imaging studies in model systems will also be considered if directly relevant to human disorders and treatment. These examples are meant to be illustrative and not exclusive. The research published in this journal is expected to be of broad interest to researchers and clinicians in fields addressing brainbehavior relationships (e.g., neuropsychology, psychiatry, neurology, neurosurgery, radiology, rehabilitation, and cognitive neuroscience). The journal publishes original research, brief reports, systematic reviews, and letters to the editor.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Behavioral

Emphasis is placed on the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to human disease as revealed by genetic, epidemiological, and biologic investigations. Genetic Epidemiology primarily publishes papers in statistical genetics, a research field that is primarily concerned with development of statistical, bioinformatical, and computational models for analyzing genetic data. Incorporation of underlying biology and population genetics into conceptual models is favored. The Journal seeks original articles comprising either applied research or innovative statistical, mathematical, computational, or genomic methodologies that advance studies in genetic epidemiology. Other types of reports are encouraged, such as letters to the editor, topic reviews, and perspectives from other fields of research that will likely enrich the field of genetic epidemiology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=22162&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=22162\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Emphasizing rapid dissemination of key data and new physical insights, APL offers prompt publication of new experimental and theoretical papers reporting applications of physics phenomena to all branches of science, engineering, and modern technology. In addition to regular articles, the journal also publishes invited Fast Track, Perspectives, and in-depth Editorials which report on cutting-edge areas in applied physics. APL Perspectives are forward-looking invited letters which highlight recent developments or discoveries. Emphasis is placed on very recent developments, potentially disruptive technologies, open questions and possible solutions. They also include a mini-roadmap detailing where the community should direct efforts in order for the phenomena to be viable for application and the challenges associated with meeting that performance threshold. Perspectives are characterized by personal viewpoints and opinions of recognized experts in the field. Fast Track articles are invited original research articles that report results that are particularly novel and important or provide a significant advancement in an emerging field. Because of the urgency and scientific importance of the work, the peer review process is accelerated. If, during the review process, it becomes apparent that the paper does not meet the Fast Track criterion, it is returned to a normal track.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27030&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=27030\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal welcomes original research articles, reviews and tutorials that bridge the following areas: pharmacometrics, modeling and simulation as applied to the design and evaluation of clinical trials, systems pharmacology modeling, particularly with a mechanistic link to human (patho)physiology, disease modeling, “population” or mixed-effects pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) modeling, modeling and simulation to support translational research, physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK), model-based meta-analyses of clinical trials, mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, computational pharmacology, bioinformatics, comparative efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Systems pharmacology may involve the application of systems biology approaches to study drug activities, targets and effects. The discipline is often defined with reference to engineering and pharmacological principles as the quantitative analysis of the dynamic interactions between drugs and a biologic system that aims to understand the behavior of the system as a whole.

Frequently, structural topological insights are needed in the discovery and analysis of fundamental mechanisms in applications. The investigation of large data sets often requires development of new algorithms, which in turn depend on mathematical insights. The Journal of Applied and Computational Topology is devoted to publishing high-quality research articles bridging algebraic and combinatorial topology on the one side and science and engineering on the other. It aims to serve both mathematicians and users of mathematical methods. We invite research contributions: from within the sciences, with focus on essential uses of topological methods and, from within topology, with a strong applied component or motivation from science and engineering. We particularly encourage the submission of topical surveys and expository articles.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computational Mathematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computational Mathematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computational Mathematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geometry and Topology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101080470&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101080470\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In order to guarantee a balanced program, articles are published to reflect the developments in all fields of urology on an internationally advanced level. Each issue treats a main topic in review articles of invited international experts. Free papers are unrelated articles to the main topic. Manuscripts submitted for publication must contain a statement to the effect that all human studies have been approved by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. It should also be stated clearly in the text that all persons gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. Details that might disclose the identity of the subjects under study should be omitted. Reports of animal experiments must state that the \"Principles of laboratory animal care\" (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1985) were followed, as well as specific national laws (e.g. the current version of the German Law on the Protection of Animals) where applicable. The Editor-in-Chief reserve the right to reject manuscripts that do not comply with the above-mentioned requirements.

All papers should be easily amenable to biologists and as such help bridge the gap between theories and applications. It both complements SAGE Publishing's subject-specific journals in the area and also seeks to place bioinformatics in the broader context of biology. The journal welcomes all submissions in the field of bioinformatics and also submissions dealing with the relationship between bioinformatics and the broader field of biology. Submissions of original research, reviews, tutorials, rapid communications, expert commentaries, letters, application notes, and point–counter-point articles are welcomed for peer review. No word limits are imposed, but authors are reminded that excessive word-counts may attract adverse comment by peer reviewers and discourage readers. This journal welcomes new manuscripts for peer review on the following topics: Bioinformatics Computational biology and the broader field of biology Methods used in the analysis and annotation of structures The relationship between bioinformatics and the broader field of biology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied

It is a compendium of new and sometimes controversial advances in social science methodology. Contributions come from diverse areas and have something new and useful—and sometimes surprising—to say about a wide range of methodological topics. SM seeks qualitative and quantitative contributions that address the full range of methodological problems confronted by empirical research in the social sciences, including conceptualization, data analysis, data collection, measurement, modeling, and research design. The journal provides a natural forum for engaging the philosophical issues that underpin sociological research. Papers published in SM are original methodological contributions including new methodological developments, reviews or illustrations of recent developments that provide new methodological insights, and critical evaluative discussions of research practices and traditions. SM encourages the inclusion of applications to real-world sociological data. SM is published annually as an edited, hardbound book.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18090&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18090\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Chevrel with the purpose of promoting clinical studies and basic research as they apply to groin hernias and the abdominal wall . Since that time, a true revolution in the field of hernia studies has transformed the field from a ”simple” disease to one that is very specialized. While the majority of surgeries for primary inguinal and abdominal wall hernia are performed in hospitals worldwide, complex situations such as multi recurrences, complications, abdominal wall reconstructions and others are being studied and treated in specialist centers. As a result, major institutions and societies are creating specific parameters and criteria to better address the complexities of hernia surgery. Hernia is a journal written by surgeons who have made abdominal wall surgery their specific field of interest, but we will consider publishing content from any surgeon who wishes to improve the science of this field. The Journal aims to ensure that hernia surgery is safer and easier for surgeons as well as patients, and provides a forum to all surgeons in the exchange of new ideas, results, and important research that is the basis of professional activity.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21593&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21593\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Drawing on a wide variety of disciplines, organization design analyzes how organizations of any kind work, and how they can work better, focusing on the choices about structures, systems, and processes as well as emergent phenomena such as culture and networks that drive various organizational outcomes. The journal advances understanding of topics important to academic researchers and industry professionals alike. We aim to publish original research and commentary on known or novel organization design concepts and phenomena; examine new technologies for the design and management of organizations; derive practical implications from existing studies; and analyze new and unusual forms of organizing.

It is designed to serve researchers and clinicians in the field of rheumatology. RHEUMATOLOGY INTERNATIONAL will cover all modern trends in clinical research as well as in the management of rheumatic diseases. Special emphasis will be given to public health issues related to rheumatic diseases, applying rheumatology research to clinical practice, epidemiology of rheumatic diseases, diagnostic tests for rheumatic diseases, patient reported outcomes (PROs) in rheumatology and evidence on education of rheumatology. Contributions to these topics will appear in the form of original publications, short communications, editorials, and reviews. \"Letters to the editor\" will be welcome as an enhancement to discussion. Basic science research, including in vitro or animal studies, is discouraged to submit, as we will only review studies on humans with an epidemological or clinical perspective. Case reports without a proper review of the literatura (Case-based Reviews) will not be published. Every effort will be made to ensure speed of publication while maintaining a high standard of contents and production. Manuscripts submitted for publication must contain a statement to the effect that all human studies have been reviewed by the appropriate ethics committee and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in an appropriate version of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. It should also be stated clearly in the text that all persons gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. Details that might disclose the identity of the subjects under study should be omitted.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Immunology and Allergy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Rheumatology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19773&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

New approaches to the assessment of student achievement have been complemented by the increasing prominence of educational assessment as a policy issue. In particular, there has been a growth of interest in modes of assessment that promote, as well as measure, standards and quality. These have profound implications for individual learners, institutions and the educational system itself. Assessment in Education provides a focus for scholarly output in the field of assessment. The journal is explicitly international in focus and encourages contributions from a wide range of assessment systems and cultures. The journal's intention is to explore both commonalities and differences in policy and practice.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5700153364&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5700153364\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Powder Technology publishes papers on all aspects of the formation of particles and their characterisation and on the study of systems containing particulate solids. No limitation is imposed on the size of the particles, which may range from nanometre scale, as in pigments or aerosols, to that of mined or quarried materials. The following list of topics is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather to indicate typical subjects which fall within the scope of the journal's interests: Formation and synthesis of particles by precipitation and other methods. Modification of particles by agglomeration, coating, comminution and attrition. Characterisation of the size, shape, surface area, pore structure and strength of particles and agglomerates (including the origins and effects of inter particle forces). Packing, failure, flow and permeability of assemblies of particles. Particle-particle interactions and suspension rheology. Handling and processing operations such as slurry flow, fluidization, pneumatic conveying. Interactions between particles and their environment, including delivery of particulate products to the body. Applications of particle technology in production of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, foods, pigments, structural, and functional materials and in environmental and energy related matters. For materials-oriented contributions we are looking for articles revealing the effect of particle/powder characteristics (size, morphology and composition, in that order) on material performance or functionality and, ideally, comparison to any industrial standard.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=13717&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=13717\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal publishes original (not previously published) work of exceptional quality and interest without regard to substantive focus, theoretical orientation, or methodological approach. Although theoretically ambitious, empirically grounded articles are the core of what we publish, we also welcome agenda setting essays, comments on previously published works, critical reflections on the research act, and interventions into substantive areas or theoretical debates intended to push the field ahead. Sociology of Religion has published work by renowned scholars from Nancy Ammerman to Robert Wuthnow. Robert Bellah, Niklas Luhmann, Talcott Parsons, and Pitirim Sorokin all published in the pages of this journal. More recently, articles published in Sociology of Religion have won the ASA Religion Section’s Distinguished Article Award (Rhys Williams in 2000) and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion’s Distinguished Article Award (Matthew Lawson in 2000 and Fred Kniss in 1998). Building on this legacy, Sociology of Religion aspires to be the premier English-language publication for sociological scholarship on religion and an essential source for agenda-setting work in the field.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Religious Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18140&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18140\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Of particular interest are articles that weave science, technology, law and policy to craft sophisticated yet practical solutions for securing assets in the various critical infrastructure sectors. These critical infrastructure sectors include: information technology, telecommunications, energy, banking and finance, transportation systems, chemicals, critical manufacturing, agriculture and food, defense industrial base, public health and health care, national monuments and icons, drinking water and water treatment systems, commercial facilities, dams, emergency services, nuclear reactors, materials and waste, postal and shipping, and government facilities. Protecting and ensuring the continuity of operation of critical infrastructure assets are vital to national security, public health and safety, economic vitality, and societal wellbeing. The scope of the journal includes, but is not limited to: 1. Analysis of security challenges that are unique or common to the various infrastructure sectors. 2. Identification of core security principles and techniques that can be applied to critical infrastructure protection. 3. Elucidation of the dependencies and interdependencies existing between infrastructure sectors and techniques for mitigating the devastating effects of cascading failures. 4.

Family psychology is a complex field, as it includes systems perspectives on the multiple influences on relationships, developmental perspectives on how relationships are formed and sustained over time, cultural perspectives on how society and traditions affect relationships, the intersection of individual differences and social relationships, and practice components in how to affect real and meaningful changes in couple, parent, and family relationships. JFP addresses societal challenges faced by families today. Important societal challenges facing families today — risk for divorce in vulnerable families, couple and marital satisfaction in military families, child-raising challenges and positive outcomes in immigrant families, risk and resilience in families who adopt, and relationship transitions in diverse couples and families (e.g., in terms of race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability) — are examples of topics addressed in JFP. JFP publishes important studies on what makes couple and family relationships work. JFP consistently publishes strong empirical studies on what keeps couples together, what makes for strong parent–child relationships, and the subtle nuances in predicting healthy relationships over time. JFP is a leader in publishing reports that use cutting-edge, sophisticated approaches to research design and data analysis. Actor–partner modeling, bootstrapping, use of phantom data, mixed methods, qualitative inquiry, structural equation modeling with moderators and mediators — these are just a few of the sophisticated approaches commonly used in JFP reports. Close to half of the highly cited works in JFP are longitudinal studies.[...]","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15503&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15503\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The Journal's objective is to help improve global health by broadly considering policy context, processes, outcomes, and influences. Policy and politics often blur the boundaries between medical and scientific evidence and social values, especially in a globalizing world. Medical practice occurs in an increasingly complex environment governed by global trade, socio-cultural interactions, and rapid technological advances. Regulations, laws, international relations, and natural and human made disasters all influence medical care and preventive services. Global economic imperatives, diplomacy, disasters and humanitarian interventions impact health outcomes — often in unexpected and unintended ways. The World Medical & Health Policy Journal will highlight the practical implications of political and policy choices, and will include opinions and case studies from practitioners in the field alongside scholarly research articles. By bringing a global policy perspective to medical practice, the journal helps readers navigate the often tangled world of regulations, liability, and standards of care, and deepens their awareness of ethics, practices, and the socio-economic context in which they are created. By translating empirical evidence into policy, the journal also helps policymakers design programs and promote regulations that improve health outcomes, with special attention to proper allocation of scarce resources and needs of vulnerable populations.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900192123&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900192123\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Medical mycology as part of medical microbiology is advancing rapidly. Effective therapeutic strategies are already available in chemotherapy and are being further developed. Their application requires reliable laboratory diagnostic techniques, which, in turn, result from mycological basic research. Opportunistic mycoses vary greatly in their clinical and pathological symptoms, because the underlying disease of a patient at risk decisively determines their symptomatology and progress. The journal Mycoses is therefore of interest to scientists in fundamental mycological research, mycological laboratory diagnosticians and clinicians interested in fungal infections.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious

Nanocomposites differ from conventional composite materials due to the nanoscale dimensions of the filler phase and the exceptionally high surface to volume ratio of this phase. As a result they often possess unique mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical or catalytic properties which are controlled by factors such as local chemistry, mobility, morphology, or crystallinity. In addition, nanocomposites often offer a combination of several properties, making them even more attractive as multifunctional materials for the future, with potential applications in aerospace, healthcare, energy materials, sensors and other systems. The journal will deal with all aspects of polymeric and ceramic nanocomposites and nano-engineered composites, from nanoparticles, synthesis, morphology, structure, interfacial bonding, ageing, properties (e.g. mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, wear, barrier, flame retardancy, antifouling, sensing and drug release) and characterization, processing to potential applications.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ceramics and Composites","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ceramics and Composites","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ceramics and Composites","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ceramics and Composites","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ceramics and Composites","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ceramics and Composites","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Materials Chemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mechanical Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mechanical Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mechanical Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mechanical Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mechanical Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mechanical Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mechanics of Materials","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100922667&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100922667\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The primary goal of this journal is to provide practitioners with an intellectual platform to showcase and appraise current research and theoretical and methodological directions for the 21st century. Although there has been an exponential increase in ethnoarchaeological and experimental research in the past thirty years, there is little that unifies or defines our subdiscipline. Ethnoarchaeology addresses this need, exploring what distinguishes ethnoarchaeological and experimental approaches, what methods connect practitioners, and what unique suite of research attributes we contribute to the better understanding of the human condition. In addition to research articles, the journal publishes book and other media reviews, periodic theme issues, and position statements by noted scholars.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Anthropology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Archeology (arts and humanities)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100386860&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100386860\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

These papers should promote and disseminate scientific knowledge and information in the fields of system theory, control systems, distributed systems, bioengineering, robotics and automation, human-robot interaction, human-machine interfaces and interaction, robot ethics, social and service robotics, medical robotics, mechatronics, unmanned systems, multi-robot teams and networked swarms, machine intelligence, learning, system autonomy, cyber physical systems, and other related areas in which cutting edge technologies have been developed and applied to model, design, build and test complex engineering and autonomous systems. A major focus of JINT is system autonomy, levels of autonomy and metrics to measure autonomy as integral ingredients of designing and building high-confidence systems. JINT is the only peer-reviewed journal putting emphasis on system ‘intelligence’ and ‘intelligent behavior’ as desirable attributes of system design, which subsequently leads to semi- or fully- autonomous systems that operate in dynamic and uncertain environments. Coupled with the quest for autonomy and autonomous operation of Unmanned Systems that has taken center stage in research and development, JINT welcomes archive and original papers on ‘design for autonomy’, as well as on efficient human-machine interfaces that reduce the operator workload.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=24360&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=24360\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Historically, the primary function of the adipose tissue was limited to energy storage and thermoregulation. However, a plethora of research over the past 3 decades has recognized the dynamic role of the adipose tissue and its contribution to a variety of physiological processes including reproduction, angiogenesis, apoptosis, inflammation, blood pressure, coagulation, fibrinolysis, immunity and general metabolic homeostasis. The field of Adipose Tissue research has grown tremendously, and Adipocyte is the first international peer-reviewed journal of its kind providing a multi-disciplinary forum for research focusing exclusively on all aspects of adipose tissue physiology and pathophysiology. Adipocyte accepts high-profile submissions in basic, translational and clinical research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Histology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100456202&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100456202\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Led by an outstanding Editorial Board of international experts, this multidisciplinary open-access journal is at the forefront of disseminating and communicating scientific knowledge and impactful discoveries to researchers, academics, clinicians and the public worldwide. Our goal is to publish research related to furthering the understanding of the integrative mechanisms underlying brain functioning across one or more interacting levels of neural organization. In most real life experiences, sensory inputs from several modalities converge and interact in a manner that influences perception and actions generating purposeful and social behaviors. The journal is therefore focused on the primary questions of how multiple sensory, cognitive and emotional processes merge to produce coordinated complex behavior. It is questions such as this that cannot be answered at a single level – an ion channel, a neuron or a synapse – that we wish to focus on. In Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience we welcome in vitro or in vivo investigations across the molecular, cellular, and systems and behavioral level. Research in any species and at any stage of development and aging that are focused at understanding integration mechanisms underlying emergent properties of the brain and behavior are welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cognitive Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sensory Systems","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700175114&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700175114\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It covers all diagnostic and clinical management aspects necessary to re-establish a subjective and objective harmonious oral function. Oral rehabilitation may become necessary as a result of developmental or acquired disturbances in the orofacial region, orofacial traumas, or a variety of dental and oral diseases (primarily dental caries and periodontal diseases) and orofacial pain conditions. As such, oral rehabilitation in the twenty-first century is a matter of skilful diagnosis and minimal, appropriate intervention, the nature of which is intimately linked to a profound knowledge of oral physiology, oral biology, and dental and oral pathology. The scientific content of the journal therefore strives to reflect the best of evidence-based clinical dentistry. Modern clinical management should be based on solid scientific evidence gathered about diagnostic procedures and the properties and efficacy of the chosen intervention (e.g. material science, biological, toxicological, pharmacological or psychological aspects). The content of the journal also reflects documentation of the possible side-effects of rehabilitation, and includes prognostic perspectives of the treatment modalities chosen.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dentistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=26156&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=26156\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Among the topics of interest are system modelling, identification and simulation, the analysis and design of control systems (including computer-aided design), and practical implementation. The scope encompasses technological, economic, physiological (biomedical) and other systems, including man-machine interfaces. Most of the papers published deal with original work from industrial and government laboratories and universities, but subject reviews and tutorial expositions of current methods are welcomed. Correspondence discussing published papers is also welcomed. Applications papers need not necessarily involve new theory. Papers which describe new realisations of established methods, or control techniques applied in a novel situation, or practical studies which compare various designs, would be of interest. Of particular value are theoretical papers which discuss the applicability of new work or applications which engender new theoretical applications.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science

As such, it welcomes papers which advance the understanding, design and applications of cognitive and intelligent systems, both natural and artificial. The journal brings together a broad community studying cognition in its many facets in vivo and in silico, across the developmental spectrum, focusing on individual capacities or on entire architectures. It aims to foster debate and integrate ideas, concepts, constructs, theories, models and techniques from across different disciplines and different perspectives on human-level cognition. The scope of interest includes the study of cognitive capacities and architectures - both brain-inspired and non-brain-inspired - and the application of cognitive systems to real-world problems as far as it offers insights relevant for the understanding of cognition. Cognitive Systems Research therefore welcomes mature and cutting-edge research approaching cognition from a systems-oriented perspective, both theoretical and empirically-informed, in the form of original manuscripts, short communications, opinion articles, systematic reviews, and topical survey articles from the fields of Cognitive Science (including Philosophy of Cognitive Science), Artificial Intelligence/Computer Science, Cognitive Robotics, Developmental Science, Psychology, and Neuroscience and Neuromorphic Engineering. Empirical studies will be considered if they are supplemented by theoretical analyses and contributions to theory development and/or computational modelling studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Artificial Intelligence","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Artificial

Applied Acoustics looks not only at recent developments in the understanding of acoustics but also at ways of exploiting that understanding. The Journal aims to encourage the exchange of practical experience through publication and in so doing creates a fund of technological information that can be used for solving related problems. The presentation of information in graphical or tabular form is especially encouraged. If a report of a mathematical development is a necessary part of a paper it is important to ensure that it is there only as an integral part of a practical solution to a problem and is supported by data. Applied Acoustics encourages the exchange of practical experience in the following ways: • Complete Papers • Short Technical Notes • Review Articles; and thereby provides a wealth of technological information that can be used to solve related problems. Manuscripts that address all fields of applications of acoustics ranging from medicine and NDT to the environment and buildings are welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Acoustics and Ultrasonics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12946&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12946\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers are evaluated based on established guidelines, including the fundamental nature of the study, scientific novelty, substantial improvement or advantage over existing technology or methods, and demonstrated analytical applicability. Original research papers on fundamental studies, and on novel sensor and instrumentation developments, are encouraged. Novel or improved applications in areas such as clinical and biological chemistry, environmental analysis, geochemistry, materials science and engineering, and analytical platforms for omics development are welcome. Analytical performance of methods should be determined, including interference and matrix effects, and methods should be validated by comparison with a standard method, or analysis of a certified reference material. Simple spiking recoveries may not be sufficient. The developed method should especially comprise information on selectivity, sensitivity, detection limits, accuracy, and reliability. However, applying official validation or robustness studies to a routine method or technique does not necessarily constitute novelty. Proper statistical treatment of the data should be provided. Relevant literature should be cited, including related publications by the authors, and authors should discuss how their proposed methodology compares with previously reported methods.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Analytical Chemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analytical Chemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analytical Chemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analytical Chemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analytical Chemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analytical Chemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Analytical Chemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Spectroscopy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=24555&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=24555\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Although most papers are based on regional studies, they must demonstrate new findings of international significance. We accept papers on subjects as diverse as seafloor hydrothermal systems, beach dynamics, early diagenesis, microbiological studies in sediments, palaeoclimate studies and geophysical studies of the seabed. We encourage papers that address emerging new fields, for example the influence of anthropogenic processes on coastal/marine geology and coastal/marine geoarchaeology. We insist that the papers are concerned with the marine realm and that they deal with geology: with rocks, sediments, and physical and chemical processes affecting them. Papers should address scientific hypotheses: highly descriptive data compilations or papers that deal only with marine management and risk assessment should be submitted to other journals. Papers on laboratory or modelling studies must demonstrate direct relevance to marine processes or deposits. The primary criteria for acceptance of papers is that the science is of high quality, novel, significant, and of broad international interest.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geochemistry and

There is no doubt that we have entered an exciting new era in plant biology. The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence, and the rapid progress being made in other plant genomics projects are providing unparalleled opportunities for progress in all areas of plant science. Nevertheless, enormous challenges lie ahead if we are to understand the function of every gene in the genome, and how the individual parts work together to make the whole organism. Achieving these goals will require an unprecedented collaborative effort, combining high-throughput, system-wide technologies with more focused approaches that integrate traditional disciplines such as cell biology, biochemistry and molecular genetics. Technological innovation is probably the most important catalyst for progress in any scientific discipline. Plant Methods’ goal is to stimulate the development and adoption of new and improved techniques and research tools and, where appropriate, to promote consistency of methodologies for better integration of data from different laboratories.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=6400153153&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=6400153153\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal will consider for publication studies that directly link brain function with cognitive processes, including perception, attention and consciousness, action and motor control, executive functions and cognitive control, memory, language, and emotion and social cognition. Submission of papers using methodologies such as functional and structural neuroimaging, cognitive electrophysiology, and brain stimulation to significantly advance cognitive and psychological theory is strongly encouraged. Neuropsychologia has a long history of publishing lesion-deficit studies, and these remain highly appropriate for the journal. Submission Animal studies are also welcome, provided they have a direct and explicitly specified impact on understanding the brain basis of human cognition and behavior. Studies that employ a purely behavioral approach in neurologically healthy participants are not appropriate for the journal unless the findings have a direct and significant bearing on the understanding of the neural mechanisms or systems supporting cognition and behavior. Studies of clinical populations that are primarily descriptive or intended to elucidate a clinical disorder, or that evaluate a therapeutic intervention, are not appropriate for the journal. Special issues and Review Papers are published regularly with the aim of providing authoritative surveys of topics of major interest.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Behavioral

The focus is on aspects of fluid dynamics where theory and computation are used to provide insights and data upon which solid physical understanding is revealed. We seek research papers, invited review articles, brief communications, letters and comments addressing flow phenomena of relevance to aeronautical, geophysical, environmental, material, mechanical and life sciences. Papers of a purely algorithmic, experimental or engineering application nature, and papers without significant new physical insights, are outside the scope of this journal. For computational work, authors are responsible for ensuring that any artifacts of discretization and/or implementation are sufficiently controlled such that the numerical results unambiguously support the conclusions drawn. Where appropriate, and to the extent possible, such papers should either include or reference supporting documentation in the form of verification and validation studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computational Mechanics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computational Mechanics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computational

To meet the rapidly expanding information needs of its readers, the journal combines original papers that report on progress and advances in developmental neuroscience with concise mini-reviews that provide a timely overview of key topics, new insights and ongoing controversies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15433&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15433\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Review articles are published upon occasion, but must extend conceptual understanding in health sociology, not just review what is known about a particular topic. Submissions must make a clear contribution to sociological inquiry relevant to health, but may be informed by conceptual and empirical debates from a broader range of health and social sciences. All submissions must demonstrate methodological rigour, adherence to ethical research principles, and potential for contribution to knowledge in health, health care and wellbeing. All manuscript submissions must be less than 7,500 words in length (including all text, footnotes and references). Suggestions for occasional themed special issues are welcomed. All submissions to Health Sociology Review are subject to double-blind peer review by at least two reviewers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12100155404&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12100155404\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The comparative aspects of the types of inflammatory conditions include gastrointestinal disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), parasitic diseases, toxicological manifestations of the effects of drugs and environmental agents, arthritic conditions, and inflammatory effects of injury or aging on skeletal muscle. The journal has seven main interest areas: -Drug-Disease Interactions - Conditional Pharmacology - i.e. where the condition (disease or stress state) influences the therapeutic response and side (adverse) effects from anti-inflammatory drugs. Mechanisms of drug-disease and drug disease interactions and the role of different stress states -Rheumatology - particular emphasis on methods of measurement of clinical response effects of new agents, adverse effects from anti-rheumatic drugs -Gastroenterology - with particular emphasis on animal and human models, mechanisms of mucosal inflammation and ulceration and effects of novel and established anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory agents, or antiparasitic agents -Neuro-Inflammation and Pain - model systems, pharmacology of new analgesic agents and mechanisms of neuro-inflammation and

The journal is highly interdisciplinary and covers theoretical, computational, database-driven, and experimental work emerging from linguistics, (neuro-)cognitive sciences, psychology, anthropology, biology, evolutionary theory, computer sciences, philosophy, and other relevant disciplines.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100896922&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100896922\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is focused on elucidating the malleable factors that, if altered, can change the course of a student’s educational outcomes. The journal does not publish articles that are more suited for special education journals, but it will consider studies in which special education status coexists with disadvantaged circumstances or where students at risk are placed in special education services.

It reports original research with a mechanically oriented description of substructures from nano- to macro-scales encompassing time-dependent and time-independent behaviors, material instabilities, damage and fracture mechanisms, and interactions between mechanics and electricity, chemistry and optics. Particular emphasis is placed on the inspection of strain rates, spatio-temporal scales, inception of microstructural features and their evolution, and couplings between mechanics and transport phenomena. The journal also focusses on the thermo-mechanical constitutive response of metals, polymers, soft materials, bio-materials, natural materials, ceramics, metallic glasses, granular materials, composites, shape-memory alloys, nanostructured materials, etc. Mechanics-based investigations on emerging areas such as 3D printing, additive manufacturing, bio-inspired materials, 2D materials, e.g., graphene and thin films, are encouraged. Articles that describe combined experimental/computational/analytical approaches in the above fields are also of interest.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17828&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17828\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The scope includes research on women working in the criminal justice profession, women as offenders and how they are dealt with in the criminal justice system, women as victims, and theories and tests of theories related to women and crime. The feminist critique of criminology incorporates a perspective that the paths to crime differ for males and females, thus research that uses sex as a control variable often fails to illuminate the factors that predict female criminality. This journal will highlight research that takes a perspective designed to demonstrate the gendered nature of crime and responses to crime. The main focus of the journal will be empirical research and theory, although the editor welcomes practice-oriented manuscripts.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11400153312&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11400153312\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Studies are welcome at all levels of integration ranging from molecules and cells to organisms and their environments and are expected to use state-of-the-art methodologies. Pure gene expression studies are not within the focus of our journal. To be considered for publication, papers must significantly contribute to the mechanistic understanding of physiological processes, and not be merely descriptive, or confirmatory of previous results. We encourage the submission of papers that explore the physiology of non-model as well as accepted model species and those that bridge basic and applied research. For instance, studies on agricultural plants that show new physiological mechanisms to improve agricultural efficiency are welcome. Studies performed under uncontrolled situations (e.g. field conditions) not providing mechanistic insight will not be considered for publication. The Journal of Plant Physiology publishes several types of articles: Original Research Articles, Reviews, Perspectives Articles, and Short Communications. Reviews and Perspectives will be solicited by the Editors; unsolicited reviews are also welcome but only from authors with a strong track record in the field of the review. Original research papers comprise the majority of published contributions.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop

According to the World Health Organization, 132,000 melanoma skin cancers occur globally each year. While early-stage melanoma is usually relatively easy to treat, once disease spreads prognosis worsens considerably. Therefore, research into combating advanced-stage melanoma is a high priority. New and emerging therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, B-RAF and KIT inhibitors, antiangiogenic agents and novel chemotherapy approaches hold promise for prolonging survival, but the search for a cure is ongoing. Melanoma Management publishes high-quality peer-reviewed articles on all aspects of melanoma, from prevention to diagnosis and from treatment of early-stage disease to late-stage melanoma and metastasis. The journal presents the latest research findings in melanoma research and treatment, together with authoritative reviews, cutting-edge editorials and perspectives that highlight hot topics and controversy in the field. Independent drug evaluations assess newly approved medications and their role in clinical practice. Key topics covered include: Risk factors, prevention and sun safety education Diagnosis, staging and grading Surgical excision of melanoma lesions Sentinel lymph node biopsy Biological therapies, including immunotherapy and vaccination Novel chemotherapy options Treatment of metastasis Prevention of recurrence Patient care and quality of life.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Dermatology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100463101&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100463101\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

From an algorithmic point of view, memes have come to be regarded as building-blocks of prior knowledge, expressed in arbitrary computational representations (e.g., local search heuristics, fuzzy rules, neural models, etc.), that have been acquired through experience by a human or machine, and can be imitated (i.e., reused) across problems. The Memetic Computing journal welcomes papers incorporating the aforementioned socio-cultural notion of memes into artificial systems, with particular emphasis on enhancing the efficacy of computational and artificial intelligence techniques for search, optimization, and machine learning through explicit prior knowledge incorporation. The goal of the journal is to thus be an outlet for high quality theoretical and applied research on hybrid, knowledge-driven computational approaches that may be characterized under any of the following categories of memetics: Type 1: General-purpose algorithms integrated with human-crafted heuristics that capture some form of prior domain knowledge; e.g., traditional memetic algorithms hybridizing evolutionary global search with a problem-specific local search. Type 2: Algorithms with the ability to automatically select, adapt, and reuse the most appropriate heuristics from a diverse pool of available choices; e.g., learning a mapping between global search operators and multiple local search schemes, given an optimization problem at hand. Type 3: Algorithms that autonomously learn with experience, adaptively reusing data and/or machine learning models drawn from related problems as prior knowledge in new target tasks of interest; examples include, but are not limited to, transfer learning and optimization, multi-task learning and optimization, or any other multi-X evolutionary learning and optimization methodologies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17400154829&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17400154829\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It brings together international scholarship from social scientists and health researchers to provide critical analyses of theory and practice and to explore new ways of thinking about public health. CPH encourages an interdisciplinary focus and innovative analyses. It is committed to exploring and debating issues of equity, power, social justice and oppression in health. The journal publishes empirical research articles, short reports and commentary articles.

We are happy to publish excellent short papers in any area of philosophy. Analysis is the most established and esteemed journal for short papers in philosophy. We are happy to publish excellent short papers in any area of philosophy. The absolute word limit is 4,000 words (including footnotes but excluding bibliography). Shorter papers will be preferred to longer papers, other things being equal. Because of the intense pressure on space, we have a policy of not publishing responses to papers that have appeared in other journals. Manuscripts are accepted for publication on the understanding that they have been submitted solely to Analysis and that they have not been previously published elsewhere either in whole or in part. Authors may not submit papers that are under consideration for publication elsewhere, and, if an author decides to offer a submitted paper to another journal, the paper must be withdrawn from Analysis before the new submission is made. We practise triple anonymity: the Editors and Associate Editors receive the submissions in anonymous form, as do referees, and authors are not informed of referees' identity. A large majority of submissions will be sent to referees. Our practice is to pass on referee reports to the author. The Analysis Trust is committed to implementing and maintaining the BPA/SWIP Good Practice Scheme for learned societies and journal editors. Further details of the Scheme can be found on the British Philosophical Association webpage. Once accepted, papers are usually published online within six weeks.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=22103&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=22103\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It focuses on explicit theory formation and analysis of the relationships between the structures of text, talk, language use, verbal interaction or communication, on the one hand, and societal, political or cultural micro- and macrostructures and cognitive social representations, on the other hand. That is, D&S studies society through discourse and discourse through an analysis of its socio-political and cultural functions or implications. Its contributions are based on advanced theory formation and methodologies of several disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Discourse & Society is an international journal. Its board members, contributors and readers are from many different countries, and this will also be reflected in the variety of the topics, approaches and cultural backgrounds of its articles. Discourse & Society is issue-oriented. It does not primarily follow the fashion of specific academic schools or paradigms, but focuses on relevant social, political or cultural issues or problems, which often need a complex multi-disciplinary approach. Discourse & Society is a critical journal. It favours contributions that pay attention to the detailed analysis of social and political relations of power, dominance and inequality, and to the role of discourse in their legitimation and reproduction in society, for instance in the domains of gender, race, ethnicity, class or world region. Discourse & Society is an accessible journal. Its papers are written in a clear and pedagogic style, avoid esoteric jargon, and respect the needs and interests of readers of several levels of expertise in many countries and disciplines.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics

The journal encourages contributions that demonstrate how an understanding of the basic chemical and physical phenomena may direct materials design and stimulate ideas for new or improved processing techniques, in order to obtain materials with desired structural features and properties. Ceramics International covers oxide and non-oxide ceramics, functional glasses, glass ceramics, amorphous inorganic non-metallic materials (and their combinations with metal and organic materials), in the form of particulates, dense or porous bodies, thin/thick films and laminated, graded and composite structures. Process related topics such as ceramic-ceramic joints or joining ceramics with dissimilar materials, as well as surface finishing and conditioning are also covered. Besides traditional processing techniques, manufacturing routes of interest include innovative procedures benefiting from externally applied stresses, electromagnetic fields and energetic beams, as well as top-down and self-assembly nanotechnology approaches. In addition, the journal welcomes submissions on bio-inspired and bio-enabled materials designs, experimentally validated multi scale modelling and simulation for materials design, and the use of the most advanced chemical and physical characterization techniques of structure, properties and behaviour. Technologically relevant low-dimensional systems are a particular focus of Ceramics International. These include 0, 1 and 2-D nanomaterials (also covering CNTs, graphene and related materials, and diamond-like carbons), their nanocomposites, as well as nano-hybrids and hierarchical multifunctional nanostructures that might integrate molecular, biological and electronic components.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ceramics and Composites","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ceramics

The journal provides a peer reviewed forum to report on issues of psychology and health in practice. This key publication reaches an international audience, highlighting the variation and similarities within different settings and exploring multiple health and illness issues from theoretical, practical and management perspectives. It provides a critical forum to examine the wide range of applied health and illness issues and how they incorporate psychological knowledge, understanding, theory and intervention. The journal reflects the growing recognition of psychosocial issues as they affect health planning, medical care, disease reaction, intervention, quality of life, adjustment adaptation and management. For many years theoretical research was very distant from applied understanding. The emerging movement in health psychology, changes in medical care provision and training, and consumer awareness of health issues all contribute to a growing need for applied research. This journal focuses on practical applications of theory, research and experience and provides a bridge between academic knowledge, illness experience, wellbeing and health care practice.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied

Generation of specifications, design, and verification must be performed at all abstraction levels, including the system, register-transfer, logic, circuit, transistor, and process levels. To address this critical area through a common forum, the IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems was founded. The editorial board, consisting of international experts, invites original papers which emphasize the novel system integration aspects of microelectronic systems, including interactions among system design and partitioning, logic and memory design, digital and analog circuit design, layout synthesis, CAD tools, chips and wafer fabrication, testing and packaging, and system level qualification. Thus, the coverage of this Transactions focuses on VLSI/ULSI microelectronic system integration. Topics of special interest include, but are not strictly limited to, the following: • System Specification, Design and Partitioning, • System-level Test, • Reliable VLSI/ULSI Systems, • High Performance Computing and Communication Systems, • Wafer Scale Integration and Multichip Modules (MCMs), • High-Speed Interconnects in Microelectronic Systems, • VLSI/ULSI Neural Networks and Their Applications, • Adaptive Computing Systems with FPGA components, • Mixed Analog/Digital Systems, • Cost, Performance Tradeoffs of VLSI/ULSI Systems, • Adaptive Computing Using Reconfigurable

It is intended that these will be of current relevance and interest to industry, academia and other practitioners. It is evident that many specialised journals in thermal and, to some extent, in fluid disciplines tend to focus on topics that can be classified as fundamental in nature, or are ‘applied’ and near-market. Thermal Science and Engineering Progress will bridge the gap between these two areas, allowing authors to make an easy choice, should they or a journal editor feel that their papers are ‘out of scope’ when considering other journals. The range of topics covered by Thermal Science and Engineering Progress addresses the rapid rate of development being made in thermal transfer processes as they affect traditional fields, and important growth in the topical research areas of aerospace, thermal biological and medical systems, electronics and nano-technologies, renewable energy systems, food production (including agriculture), and the need to minimise man-made thermal impacts on climate change. Review articles on appropriate topics for TSEP are encouraged, although until TSEP is fully established, these will be limited in number. Before submitting such articles, please contact one of the Editors, or a member of the Editorial Advisory Board with an outline of your proposal and your expertise in the area of your review.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100842663&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100842663\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing places a strong emphasis on applied research with relevant implications for both knowledge and practice. Also, the journal aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas and opinions on research projects and issues. As such, on top of a standard section publishing scientific articles, there will be two additional sections: \"The Industry ViewPoint\": in this section, industrial practitioners from around the world will be invited (max 2 contributions per issue) to present their point of view on a relevant subject area. This is intended to give the journal not just an academic focus, but a practical focus as well. In this way, we intend to reflect a trend that has characterised the past few decades, where interests and initiatives in research, academia and industry have been more and more converging to the point of collaborative relationships being a common practice. \"Research Updates - Executive Summaries\". In this section, researchers around the world will be given the opportunity to present their research projects in the area of global sourcing and outsourcing by means of an executive summary of their project. This will increase awareness of the on-going research projects in the area and it will attract interest from industry.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100807851&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100807851\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Early people confronted with illness and disease, discovered a wealth of useful therapeutic agents in the plant and animal kingdoms. The empirical knowledge of these medicinal substances and their toxic potential was passed on by oral tradition and sometimes recorded in herbals and other texts on materia medica. Many valuable drugs of today (e.g., atropine, ephedrine, tubocurarine, digoxin, reserpine) came into use through the study of indigenous remedies. Chemists continue to use plant-derived drugs (e.g., morphine, taxol, physostigmine, quinidine, emetine) as prototypes in their attempts to develop more effective and less toxic medicinals.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Drug Discovery","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pharmacology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23015&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23015\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The five classical symptoms of inflammation, namely redness (rubor), swelling (tumour), heat (calor), pain (dolor) and loss of function (functio laesa), are only part of the story. The term inflammation is taken to include the full range of underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, not only in the production of the inflammatory responses but, more importantly in clinical terms, in the healing process as well. Thus the journal covers molecular, cellular, animal and clinical studies, and related aspects of pharmacology, such as anti-inflammatory drug development, trials and therapeutic developments. It also considers publication of negative findings. Journal of Inflammation aims to become the leading online journal on inflammation and, as online journals replace printed ones over the next decade, the main open access inflammation journal. Open access guarantees a larger audience, and thus impact, than any restricted access equivalent, and increasingly so, as the escalating costs of printed journals puts them outside University budgets. The unrestricted access to research findings in inflammation aids in promoting dynamic and productive dialogue between industrial and academic members of the inflammation research community, which plays such an important part in the development of future generations of anti-inflammatory therapies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=40695&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=40695\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The new scientific discipline of \"Infodemiology,\" first introduced in 2002, has been gaining momentum due to the COVID-19 infodemic, with the WHO recognizing it as an important pillar to manage public health emergencies. JMIR Publications is proud to have been spearheading the advancement of this new scientific discipline for more than a decade. We are now accelerating the development of this new interdisciplinary discipline with the first and only journal devoted to this rapidly evolving field, by bringing together thought leaders in research, data science, and policy. Areas of interest include information monitoring (infoveillance, including social listening); ehealth literacy and science literacy; knowledge refinement and quality improvement processes and policies; and the influence of political and commercial interests on effective knowledge translation.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Information Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Information Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101129622&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101129622\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

A paper will be considered for publication if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: The paper includes results or discussions which can be considered original and highly interesting. The paper presents a new method. The author reviews a problem or a class of problems with such profound insight that further research is encouraged. The readers of ZAMP will find not only articles in their own special field but also original work in neighbouring domains. This will lead to an exchange of ideas; concepts and methods which have proven to be successful in one field may well be useful to other areas. ZAMP attempts to publish articles reasonably quickly. Longer papers are published in the section \"Original Papers\", shorter ones may appear under \"Brief Reports\" where publication is particularly rapid. The journal includes a \"Book Review\" section and provides information on activities (such as upcoming symposia, meetings or special courses) which are of interest to its readers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied

Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, materials lists with supplier information, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, recipes for reagents and solutions, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols in Neuroscience to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments. Topics include: Neuroanatomical Methods Imaging Cellular and Developmental Neuroscience Gene Cloning, Expression, and Mutagenesis Molecular Neuroscience Neurophysiology Neurochemistry/Neuropharmacology Behavioral Neuroscience Preclinical Models of Neurologic and Psychiatric Disorders Human Neuroscience.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11600153416&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11600153416\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
