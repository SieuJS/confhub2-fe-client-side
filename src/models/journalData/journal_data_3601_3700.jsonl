In addition, articles that use animal models to address cognitive or affective processes involving behavioral, invasive, or imaging methods are also highly welcome. One of the main goals of CABN is to be the premier outlet for strongly psychologically motivated studies of brain–behavior relationships. Thus, the editors highly encourage papers with clear integration between psychological theory and the conduct and interpretation of the neuroscientific data. Articles will be appropriate to the journal if they cover: (1) topics relating to cognition, such as perception, attention, memory, language, problem solving, reasoning, and decision-making; (2) topics concerning emotional processes, motivation, reward prediction, and affective states; and (3) topics relating to individual differences in relevant domains, including personality.

The journal is particularly interested in the place of gender in relation to other key differences and seeks to further feminist knowledge, philosophies, theory, action and debate. The Editors are actively committed to making the journal an interactive platform that includes global perspectives on education, gender and culture. Submissions to the journal should examine and theorize the interrelated experiences of gendered subjects including women, girls, men, boys, and gender-diverse individuals. Papers should consider how gender shapes and is shaped by other social, cultural, discursive, affective and material dimensions of difference. Gender and Education expects articles to engage in feminist debate, to draw upon a range of theoretical frameworks and to go beyond simple descriptions. Education is interpreted in a broad sense to cover both formal and informal aspects, including pre-school, primary, and secondary education; families and youth cultures inside and outside schools; adult, community, further and higher education; vocational education and training; media education; and parental education.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gender Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29390&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29390\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The emphasis on journalism practice does not imply any false or intellectually disabling disconnect between theory and practice, but simply an assertion that Journalism Practice’s primary concern is to analyse and explore issues of practice and professional relevance. Journalism Practice is an intellectually rigorous journal with all contributions being refereed anonymously by acknowledged international experts in the field. An intellectually lively, but professionally experienced, Editorial Board with a wide-ranging experience of journalism practice advises and supports the Editor. Journalism Practice is devoted to: the study and analysis of significant issues arising from journalism as a field of professional practice; relevant developments in journalism training and education, as well as the construction of a reflective curriculum for journalism; analysis of journalism practice across the distinctive but converging media platforms of magazines, newspapers, online, radio and television; and the provision of a public space for practice-led, scholarly contributions from journalists as well as academics. Journalism Practice’s ambitious scope includes: the history of journalism practice; the professional practice of journalism; journalism training and education; journalism practice and new technology; journalism practice and ethics; and journalism practice and policy.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11600153484&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11600153484\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We are interested in studies that have the potential to transform our understanding of the immunopathology of human disease and/or change clinical practice. The journal is among the foremost journals in the field of translational and clinical immunology, attracting high-quality papers from across the world. Translation is viewed as a process of applying ideas, insights and discoveries generated through scientific studies to the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of human disease. Clinical immunology has evolved as a field to encompass the application of state-of-the-art technologies such as next-generation sequencing, metagenomics and high-dimensional phenotyping to understand the mechanisms that govern the outcomes of clinical trials. Journal articles are received by our dedicated Section Editors and cover basic and clinical investigations into the immunological basis of a wide range of human pathologies including autoimmunity, inflammatory diseases, primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, complement disorders, allergies, infectious diseases, cancer and transplantation rejection. Research that offers mechanistic insight is particularly encouraged. Studies that inform clinical practice and those that represent position papers on the classification, diagnosis or treatment of immunological disease are also welcomed. Any paper which does not fit into one of the sections described below will be assessed by our Editor-in-Chief. All papers with high relevance to translational immunology are welcome.

By exploring the interplay between political actors, governing institutions and policy issues, the journal contributes to theories of the policy process. By reflecting on the evolving context in which these interactions occur, it provides critical insights that are timely and fresh. Policy & Politics has an international reputation in the fields of political science, public administration and social policy. It is committed to publishing articles that are original and innovative; that engage with the world’s most pressing policy issues; and that have relevance both within and beyond academe. The journal welcomes manuscripts that are empirical, conceptual or theoretical, as long as the broader international relevance of the argument is explicit. It is critical that all articles demonstrate a clear contribution to knowledge, and it is crucial that articles are explicit about the specific empirical and/or theoretical advance that it offers. One of the hallmarks of the journal is the manner in which its articles generally shift from the micro to the macro (or vice versa) by addressing the link between ‘policy’ and ‘politics’. For example, while single-case studies might form the basis of an article, the broader significance and relevance of that study must be made explicit. Where articles deal with broad macro-political or economic issues they may also drill-down to some discussion of the micro-level implications of that analysis. Successful articles will generally demonstrate both analytical breadth and depth in the coverage of their subject matter. Articles must be written in a clear and accessible style suitable for a multi-disciplinary and global audience.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and

The journal brings together some of the most influential thinkers and writers as well as emerging scholars on educational change. It deals with issues like educational innovation, reform and restructuring, school improvement and effectiveness, culture-building, inspection, school-review, and change management. It examines why some people resist change and what their resistance means. It looks at how men and women, older teachers and younger teachers, students, parents and others experience change differently. It looks at the positive aspects of change but does not hesitate to raise uncomfortable questions about many aspects of educational change either. It looks critically and controversially at the social, economic, cultural and political forces that are driving educational change. The Journal of Educational Change welcomes and supports contributions from a range of disciplines, including history, psychology, political science, sociology, anthropology, philosophy and administrative and organizational theory, and from a broad spectrum of methodologies including quantitative and qualitative approaches, documentary study, action research and conceptual development. School leaders, system administrators, teacher leaders, consultants, facilitators, educational researchers, staff developers and change agents of all kinds will find this journal an indispensable resource for guiding them to both classic and cutting-edge understandings of educational change.

It seeks to publish high-quality papers that substantively contribute to the modeling, analysis, and control of stochastic systems. A paper’s contribution may lie in the formulation of new mathematical models, in the development of new mathematical or computational methods, in the innovative application of existing methods, or in the opening of new application domains. Relative to application-focused journals, Stochastic Systems publishes papers in which applied probability plays a significant, and not just supporting, role. Relative to other applied probability outlets, Stochastic Systems focuses exclusively on operations research content. Papers at the interface of stochastics, modeling, statistics, and data science are highly relevant. A partial list of applications of interest is service operations; healthcare; logistics and transportation; communications networks (including the Internet); computer systems; finance and risk management; manufacturing operations and supply chains; market and mechanism design; revenue management and pricing; the sharing economy; social networks; cloud computing. While many papers at Stochastic Systems have a methodological focus, methodological content is not necessary for publication. The journal also welcomes papers that present techniques or insights that advance the practice of applied probability. A simple but novel idea with high realized or potential impact is relevant. The main criteria for publication of such applied papers are (1) Innovation: does the paper present new ideas, or existing ideas in a new setting? (2) Application: is the paper truly useful to practice? (3) Translation: can the ideas in the paper be applied to many different settings/organizations?","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistics and Probability","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101021638&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101021638\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The scope of the journal extends to the environmental, management and economic aspects of biomass and bioenergy. Key areas covered by the journal: • Biomass: sources, energy crop production processes, genetic improvements, composition. Please note that research on these biomass subjects must be linked directly to bioenergy generation. • Biological Residues: residues/rests from agricultural production, forestry and plantations (palm, sugar etc), processing industries, and municipal sources (MSW). Papers on the use of biomass residues through innovative processes/technological novelty and/or consideration of feedstock/system sustainability (or unsustainability) are welcomed. However waste treatment processes and pollution control or mitigation which are only tangentially related to bioenergy are not in the scope of the journal, as they are more suited to publications in the environmental arena. Papers that describe conventional waste streams (ie well described in existing literature) that do not empirically address 'new' added value from the process are not suitable for submission to the journal. • Bioenergy Processes: fermentations, thermochemical conversions, liquid and gaseous fuels, and petrochemical substitutes • Bioenergy Utilization: direct combustion, gasification, electricity production, chemical processes, and by-product remediation • Biomass and the Environment: carbon cycle, the net energy efficiency of bioenergy systems, assessment of sustainability, and biodiversity issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and
