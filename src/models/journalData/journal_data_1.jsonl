Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, resources lists, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols in Bioinformatics to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments.

It promotes studies that aim at the unification of the theoretical-quantitative and the empirical-quantitative approach to economic problems and that are penetrated by constructive and rigorous thinking. It explores a unique range of topics each year - from the frontier of theoretical developments in many new and important areas, to research on current and applied economic problems, to methodologically innovative, theoretical and applied studies in econometrics. Econometrica maintains a long tradition that submitted articles are refereed carefully and that detailed and thoughtful referee reports are provided to the author as an aid to scientific research, thus ensuring the high calibre of papers found in Econometrica. An international board of editors, together with the referees it has selected, has succeeded in substantially reducing editorial turnaround time, thereby encouraging submissions of the highest quality. We strongly encourage recent Ph. D. graduates to submit their work to Econometrica. Our policy is to take into account the fact that recent graduates are less experienced in the process of writing and submitting papers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19482&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19482\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Our growing thirst for energy must either be matched by supply or else adapted to meet it. Tackling these challenges is an essential part of many fields of research — both in the natural and social and behavioural sciences and economics — and is the focus of multi-billion-dollar global industries. Publishing monthly, Nature Energy is dedicated to exploring all aspects of this on-going discussion, from the generation and storage of energy, to its distribution and management, the needs and demands of the different actors, and the impacts that energy technologies and policies have on societies. We have a particular interest in studies that advance our knowledge and inform the development of next-generation technologies and solutions. Nature Energy provides a forum for all parties active at the frontiers of energy to come together and learn about the different facets of this sector. Like all Nature-branded journals, Nature Energy is characterized by a dedicated team of professional editors, a fair and rigorous peer-review process, high standards of copy-editing and production, swift publication and editorial independence. In addition to publishing original research, Nature Energy will publish Comments, Perspectives, Reviews, News & Views, Features and Correspondence from across the full range of disciplines concerned with energy. Topics covered in the journal include: Solar energy Wind energy Wave energy Geothermal energy Hydroelectricity Energy harvesting devices Nuclear power Fuel cells Hydrogen energy Transportation fuels Biofuels Batteries Supercapacitors Electrocatalysis and photocatalysis Carbon capture and storage Energy economics and finance Energy policy Energy and behaviour Energy security Energy access Energy justice Energy grids and networks Nature Energy Wireless network consulting services","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Energy Engineering and Power Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Fuel Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100812579&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100812579\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Often called \"reviews with an attitude,\" Annals papers summarize and/or challenge established assumptions and concepts, pinpoint problems and factual errors, inspire discussions, and illuminate possible avenues for further study. Reviews published in Annals move above and beyond descriptions of the field – they motivate conceptual integration and set agendas for future research. 'It's an exceptional volume—and exceptionally timely to boot. I found myself trying to put this new Annals in perspective. I tried, in particular, to cast a rather hard and critical light on this volume: Just how essential is it for the time-starved and besieged scholar to have yet another thing to keep up with? Do we really need, in short, yet another annual volume? The answer I gave myself to this question was a resounding, ''Yes!''' Review in International Public Management Journal (2008) ANNALS is released in January and July.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900191906&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900191906\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Materials research is a diverse and fast-growing discipline, which has moved from a largely applied, engineering focus to a position where it has an increasing impact on other classical disciplines such as physics, chemistry and biology. Nature Materials covers all applied and fundamental aspects of the synthesis/processing, structure/composition, properties and performance of materials, where \"materials\" are identified as substances in the condensed states (liquid, solid, colloidal) designed or manipulated for technological ends. Nature Materials provides a forum for the development of a common identity among materials scientists while encouraging researchers to cross established subdisciplinary divides. To achieve this, and strengthen the cohesion of the community, the journal takes an interdisciplinary, integrated and balanced approach to all areas of materials research while fostering the exchange of ideas between scientists involved in the different disciplines. Nature Materials is an invaluable resource for all scientists, in both academia and industry, who are active in the process of discovering and developing materials and materials-related concepts. Nature Materials offers an engaging, informative and accessible product including papers of exceptional significance and quality in a discipline which promises to have great influence on the development of society in years to come.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Chemistry
