Its subject areas reflect the concerns of policymakers in government, management strategists in industry, and the public at large, providing independent, original and rigorous analysis to understand how policy and strategy decisions have been made, monitor their effects, and suggest how they may be improved. The journal covers the entire transport sector including all modes: air, maritime, urban, intercity, domestic and international transport economics, policy and strategy issues, etc. Policy and strategy concerns in transport are wide and cover safety, efficiency, economic development, infrastructure, environment, energy, land-use, equity and access. Papers are expected to have clear policy and strategy relevance, to analyze/evaluate transport policies and strategies using up-to-date research methods (both quantitative and qualitative). Papers are also welcomed which focus on understanding the nature and influences affecting policy and strategy change, including technical, attitudinal, institutional, structural and political constraints, including those which provide a comparative analysis. Papers focusing only on methodological development without clear policy focus and relevance will NOT be considered. However, we welcome qualitative policy papers that build on the body of literature, and show clear contributions over and above what exist in the literature, and/or widely applicable to other jurisdictions. (Qualitative papers will NOT be considered if the author(s) advocate certain policy positions without presenting a rigorous framework of analysis.) Papers that focus entirely on individual case studies are more appropriate for our sister journal Case Studies in Transport Policy.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and

By presenting clear, insightful, balanced reviews that emphasize recently published papers of major importance, the journal elucidates current and emerging approaches to identification, characterization, management, treatment, and prevention of environmental pollution. We accomplish this aim by appointing eminent authorities to serve as Section Editors in key subject areas across the field, such as water, soils, sediments, air, noise, and emerging contaminants. Section Editors, in turn, select topics for which leading experts contribute comprehensive review articles that emphasize new developments and recently published papers of major importance. Every manuscript undergoes a single-blind peer-review process via Editorial Manager in which at least two outside reviewers assess the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the papers and offer recommendations for revisions. An acclaimed and highly selective international Editorial Board reviews the annual table of contents, suggests articles of special interest to their respective fields, and ensures that topics are current and include emerging research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pollution","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Water Science and Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100873342&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100873342\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal's mission is to publish significant research which has important implications for physiotherapy (also known as physical therapy). Our vision is for the journal to be the pre-eminent international publication of the science and practice of physiotherapy. In January 2008 Journal of Physiotherapy became the first physiotherapy journal to conform to the ICMJE requirement wherein randomised trials are registered with a recognised Trial Registry. The journal prioritises systematic reviews and reports of clinical trials, economic analyses, experimental studies, qualitative studies, epidemiological studies, and observational studies. In January 2014 the journal became the first core physiotherapy / physical therapy journal to make Editorials and peer-reviewed original research freely-available. In 2016 the APA extended their support of excellence in physiotherapy practice by sponsoring Open Access publication of all Journal of Physiotherapy content. All past, present and future journal articles are therefore freely accessible. There are no author fees for publication.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700176802&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700176802\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal considers manuscripts from the wide range of topics relevant to adolescent development, using rigorous quantitative or qualitative methodologies, and considering samples during the second decade of life (though samples of university students aged about 18-20 years need a strong justification that the sample is not one of convenience). Manuscripts should advance understanding of adolescent development, rather than merely study a phenomenon with an adolescent sample, and should therefore be grounded in developmental theory and prior developmental research. There are no exclusions of particular methodologies, though studies including a diverse and representative sample, with valid and multiple information sources, and/or with best practice quantitative or qualitative analysis strategies are preferred. Manuscripts should clearly articulate the advances in understanding adolescent development and the applications for improving the lives of adolescents.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Behavioral

Technologies have brought enormous benefits and opportunities, but they have also raised new and pressing challenges, whose complexity and global dimensions are rapidly expanding and evolving. Philosophy & Technology addresses such challenges, in order to improve our critical understanding of the conceptual nature and practical consequences of technologies, and hence provide the conceptual foundations for their fruitful and sustainable developments.

The journal seeks to bridge the full scope of explorations between basic research on drug discovery and clinical studies, validating putative therapies for aging-related chronic brain conditions that affect cognition, motor functions, and other behavioral or clinical symptoms associated with all forms dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The journal will publish findings from diverse domains of research and disciplines to accelerate the conversion of abstract facts into practical knowledge: specifically, to translate what is learned at the bench into bedside applications. The journal seeks to publish articles that go beyond a singular emphasis on either basic drug discovery research or clinical research. Rather, an important theme of articles will be the linkages between and among the various discrete steps in the complex continuum of therapy development. For rapid communication among a multidisciplinary research audience involving the range of therapeutic interventions, TRCI will consider only original contributions that include feature length research articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, brief reports, narrative reviews, commentaries, letters, perspectives, and research news that would advance wide range of interventions to ameliorate symptoms or alter the progression of chronic neurocognitive disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The journal will publish on topics related to medicine, geriatrics, neuroscience, neurophysiology, neurology, psychiatry, clinical psychology, bioinformatics, pharmaco-genetics, regulatory issues, health economics, pharmacoeconomics, and public health policy as these apply to preclinical and clinical research on therapeutics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100415705&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100415705\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal seeks to improve regional and global health by informing efforts to reduce the risk of communicable and non-communicable diseases and takes special interest in publishing rigorous assessments of policies which have been implemented based on epidemiological and public health research. At the Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health we believe that epidemiology and public health are closely intertwined, both scientifically and from a health policy perspective: advances in one area exert positive consequences on the other. We are particularly interested in the links between evolving epidemiologic advances and the implementation of health policy initiatives, and eventually in publishing efficacy assessments, including the assessment of unintended consequences. The Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health benefits from a diverse, multidisciplinary, experienced and international Editorial Board that will facilitate the publication of articles and perspectives reflecting a global view of public health medicine and epidemiology. The journal also aims to focus on supporting the academic, clinical and practical needs of public health practitioners in the field. As global health medicine meets unprecedented problems - the H1N1 pandemic being a recent example - imaginative approaches will be needed to influence health policy, foreign policy and even immigration policy. The resulting need for multidisciplinary research is not well served by the current body of academic literature and the journal seeks to fill this important gap.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=20500195056&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=20500195056\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

International Journal for Equity in Health publishes research which improves the understanding of issues that influence the distribution of health and healthcare within populations. This includes the discussion of political, policy-related, economic, social and health systems- and services-related influences, particularly with regard to identifying and understanding the systematic differences or the lived experiences of one or more aspects of health in population groups defined demographically, geographically, or socially. Although there is a large amount of literature on the 'social determinants' of health, the journal focuses heavily on understanding what influences at the level of the individual, and, what influences at the community level. The literature is relatively sparse on studies that look at what influences the policy and political arenas, and is especially deficient in analyses that examine the population-attributable fraction of ill health resulting from social, behavioral, medical, or biological factors, and the interrelated contributions of these spheres of influence. Such information and the insight derived from it is required by policy-makers in order to make informed choices and evidence-based decisions, and this is the focus of International Journal for Equity in Health.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21461&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21461\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The main criteria for acceptance are that a study is novel, and has general significance to biologists. Articles published cover a wide range of areas within the biological sciences, many have relevance to organisms and the environments in which they live. The scope includes, but is not limited to, ecology, evolution, behaviour, health and disease epidemiology, neuroscience and cognition, behavioural genetics, development, biomechanics, palaeontology, comparative biology, molecular ecology and evolution and global change biology. Many more good manuscripts are submitted than we have space to print, and we give preference to those presenting significant advances of broad interest. Submission of preliminary reports, of articles that merely confirm previous findings, and of articles that are likely to interest only small groups of specialists, is not encouraged. Articles will only be considered where they have clear relevance to fundamental biological principles and processes. All articles are sent to an Editorial Board member for an initial assessment, and may be returned to authors without in-depth peer review if the paper is unlikely to be accepted because it is either too specialized, not sufficiently novel, or is deficient in other respects.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences

The journal engages with theoretical, conceptual and methodological debates in the broad field of comparative education. It publishes rigorous analyses of educational phenomena, policies and developments that are of theoretical and practical importance and of relevance to scholars, policy-makers and practitioners.
