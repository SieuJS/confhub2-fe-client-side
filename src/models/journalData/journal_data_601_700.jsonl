The new Editorial Board of the Journal of Financial Intermediation seeks to streamline the editorial process by implementing an active desk-rejection policy. We anticipate that a significant fraction of papers will be rejected without a detailed reviewing process. In this way, papers going out for reviews have a significant chance of eventually being published. While the policy is meant to minimize the burden on reviewers, submitters should expect their papers to receive a more thorough treatment in the editorial process, conditional on being refereed. Desk-rejected articles will NOT be refunded the submission fee. Reducing noise and increasing transparency of the refereeing process is an overarching goal of the new editorial policy. In this vein, the JFI is simplifying its editorial board structure and expanding the board of associate editors. Submitters may now expect their papers to be reviewed almost exclusively by members of the editorial board, or by researchers whose expertise is at par with that of members of the board. At the same time, the submission process is now single-blind, implying that author identity will not be hidden. Submitters may choose the Managing Editor in charge of their submission. Such requests will be accommodated within constraints, nonetheless.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Finance","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28996&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=28996\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

All aspects of the subject in relation to manufacturing and process industries, as well as production in general are covered. The journal is interdisciplinary in nature, considering whole cycles of activities, such as the product life cycle - research, design, development, test, launch, disposal - and the material flow cycle - supply, production, distribution. The ultimate objective of the journal is to disseminate knowledge for improving industrial practice and to strengthen the theoretical base necessary for supporting sound decision making. It provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and the presentation of new developments in theory and application, wherever engineering and technology meet the managerial and economic environment in which industry operates. In character, the journal combines the high standards of a traditional academic approach with the practical value of industrial applications. Articles accepted need to be based on rigorous sound theory and contain an essential novel scientific contribution. Tracing economic and financial consequences in the analysis of the problem and solution reported, belongs to the central theme of the journal.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business, Management

A biomaterial is now defined as a substance that has been engineered to take a form which, alone or as part of a complex system, is used to direct, by control of interactions with components of living systems, the course of any therapeutic or diagnostic procedure. It is the aim of the journal to provide a peer-reviewed forum for the publication of original papers and authoritative review and opinion papers dealing with the most important issues facing the use of biomaterials in clinical practice. The scope of the journal covers the wide range of physical, biological and chemical sciences that underpin the design of biomaterials and the clinical disciplines in which they are used. These sciences include polymer synthesis and characterization, drug and gene vector design, the biology of the host response, immunology and toxicology and self assembly at the nanoscale. Clinical applications include the therapies of medical technology and regenerative medicine in all clinical disciplines, and diagnostic systems that reply on innovative contrast and sensing agents. The journal is relevant to areas such as cancer diagnosis and therapy, implantable devices, drug delivery systems, gene vectors, bionanotechnology and tissue engineering.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ceramics

Acceptable paper types are research articles (short or full communications), methods, mini-reviews, and commentaries in the following areas: -Nutrition- Polyphenolics- Cancer- Metabolism- Cardiovascular- Diabetes- Inflammation- Aging- Neuroscience- Cell and Molecular Biology- Cell Signaling- Bioenergetic. Redox Biology will also consider research articles focused in chemical or biochemical mechanisms of redox biology, if these include data demonstrating effects in physiologically relevant models. Studies of uncharacterized complex mixtures of natural products are not a suitable area of focus for the journal. Studies using commercial, undefined kits as the sole or primary assay for redox related changes which are not validated using other methods will not be considered for publication.

Transport Reviews encourages submissions from all disciplinary perspectives (e.g. economics or engineering), all relevant subject areas (e.g. social issues or environment), and all methodological approaches (e.g. modelling, qualitative approaches or mixed-methods). The reviews normally present new methodological approaches, new analysis, innovative perspectives and original data, but are not exclusively research based. Transport Reviews has authors from a range of backgrounds, including conventional academic authors, and those working in consultancies, local authorities, government departments and the international agencies. The geographic spread of authors is extensive.

Academic relevance means the research contributes to on-going academic discussions and debates on relevant topics in operations management. All manuscripts published in JOM must, in one way or another, also transcend the immediate empirical context in which the research is embedded. An ideal manuscript is one that simultaneously takes the context seriously (is empirically disciplined) and seeks some sense of generality. Practical relevance means the manuscript links explicitly to an actual, relevant managerial challenge. While manuscripts published in JOM do not necessarily have to give advice to managers, they must have something non-obvious to say about the practice of operations management. In preparing your manuscript, ask yourself: Do I think I could keep a manager interested in talking about my research for an hour? What would I say, what would I argue? An ideal manuscript balances rigor with relevance and offers a novel aspect to a topic of contemporary concern. Novelty does not necessarily mean focusing on emerging phenomena, novel approaches to examinations of established phenomena are equally interesting and relevant.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19169&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19169\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We recognize that techniques from molecular and cell biology, and functional genomics through to modelling and system-based approaches will be applied across the whole spectrum of plant science: • Physiology & Development: intra/inter-cellular signalling, long-distance signalling, physiology, development, eco-devo – phenotypic plasticity, transport, biochemistry. • Environment: global change and Earth system functioning, environmental stress, ecophysiology, plant–soil interactions, heavy metals. • Interaction: plant–biotic interactions (including viruses, prokaryotes, oomycetes, fungi/mycorrhizas, viruses, nematodes and insects), symbionts, endophytes, pathogens, plant microbiome, fungal genomics, multitrophic systems, plant–microbe–soil interactions. • Evolution: molecular evolution, population or quantitative ge- netics, mating systems, phylogenetics, speciation, plant–enemy coevolution, evo–devo.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Physiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19908&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19908\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Plant Biotechnology Journal aims to publish high-impact original research and incisive reviews by leading researchers in applied plant science, with an emphasis on molecular plant sciences and their applications through plant biotechnology. We aim to provide a forum for the most important advances in this field, including curiosity-driven studies with the potential for application, strategic research in plant biotechnology, scientific analysis of key issues for the beneficial application of plant sciences and scientific analysis of the performance of the products of plant biotechnology in practice. Plant Biotechnology Journal often receives manuscripts describing research carried out solely in model species. While the Plant Biotechnology Journal will continue to accept exceptional manuscripts describing novel and useful procedures carried out in model species, one of the strengths of the Plant Biotechnology Journal is its ability to focus on application. Therefore, from January 2011 the Plant Biotechnology Journal will immediately reject manuscripts containing high quality, but not exceptional, research relating solely to model species.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Plant Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16592&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16592\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

A primary aim of the journal is to foster communication across fields of biology, both by publishing important findings of general interest from diverse fields and through highly accessible editorial articles that explicitly aim to inform non-specialists. Current Biology publishes papers reporting findings in any area of biology that have sufficient claim to be of general interest—this could be, for example, because the advance is important for a specific field, or because it is intrinsically of wide interest to biologists generally. We have several formats for publishing original research (Articles, Reports, and Correspondences); see our Information for Authors for details.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agricultural and

Organizational Psychology Review’s unique aim is to publish original conceptual work and meta-analyses in the field of organizational psychology (broadly defined to include applied psychology, industrial psychology, occupational psychology, organizational behavior, personnel psychology, and work psychology). Articles accepted for publication in Organizational Psychology Review will have the potential to have a major impact on research and practice in organizational psychology. They will offer analyses worth citing, worth following up on in primary research, and worth considering as a basis for applied managerial practice. As such, these should be contributions that move beyond straight forward reviews of the existing literature by developing new theory and insights. At the same time, however, they should be well-grounded in the state of the art and the empirical knowledge base, providing a good mix of a firm empirical and theoretical basis and exciting new ideas.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100405117&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100405117\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Applied health related research constantly produces new findings but often these are not routinely translated into healthcare practice. Implementation research is the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of proven clinical treatments, practices, organizational, and management interventions into routine practice, and hence to improve health. This also encompasses the de-implementation of interventions demonstrated to be of low or no clinical benefit and the study of influences on patient, healthcare professional, and organizational behavior in either healthcare or population settings.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health

The editorial goal of Communication Research is to offer a special opportunity for reflection and change in the new millennium. To qualify for publication, research should, first, be explicitly tied to some form of communication; second, be theoretically driven with conclusions that inform theory; third, use the most rigorous empirical methods OR provide a review of a research area; and fourth, be directly linked to the most important problems and issues facing humankind. Criteria do not privilege any particular context; indeed, we believe that the key problems facing humankind occur in close relationships, groups, organizations, and cultures. Hence, we hope to publish research conducted across a wide variety of levels and units of analysis.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17649&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=17649\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Microbiology is, at present, one of the fastest moving disciplines in Life Sciences, thanks also to technological developments of the recent years. The relative ease and rapidity with which small genomes can be entirely sequenced is beginning to have significant impact on all areas of prokaryote biology, from pathogens to extremophiles, and will fuel new developments, for example, in drugs, vaccines and industrial enzyme research. Recent international developments are also responsible for a renewed interest in microbiology. The Table of Contents includes a lively mix of commentary, correspondence and review. Most articles are commissioned and all of them are peer-reviewed. Consequently, they make an authoritative basis for teaching and keeping abreast of developments across the field. The focus is on molecular microbiology and virology, and includes topics such as genomics, the gamut of plant and animal host-pathogen interactions, host immune responses, characterization and evolution of virulence determinants, cell cycle and differentiation, symbiosis in plant and animal associations, environmental microbiology, biodiversity and evolution, population dynamics, sex and mutagenesis, antibiotic resistance and production, drug and vaccine targets, as well as aspects of prion diseases and of fungal and protozoan biology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Infectious

The topics of interest include plastic behaviour of single crystals and polycrystalline metals, ceramics, rocks and soils, composites, nanocrystalline and microelectronics materials, shape memory alloys, ferroelectric ceramics, thin films and polymers, as well as plasticity aspects of failure and fracture mechanics. Significant experimental, numerical or theoretical contributions advancing the understanding of plastic behaviour of solids are of special interest, together with studies relating macroscopic to the microscopic behaviour of solids. Papers on modeling of finite nonlinear elastic deformation, with similarities to modeling of plastic deformation, are also welcome. The Journal will contain research papers, review articles, research notes, letters to the editor, and academic advertisements (books, journals, conferences, and symposia). Strain-rate dependent and strain-rate independent constitutive models to predict observed phemonena during quasi-static, dynamic or cyclic thermo-mechanical loading, behaviour of granular or porous solids under high confining pressures and at high temperatures, multiscale modeling of various deformation mechanisms (dislocation, twinning, and phase transformation), and models with capability for predicting the behaviour of composite materials based onknown plastic behaviour of matrix and fibers in such materials, are some examples of the main themes of this journal. Revealing applications of the new models of plasticity, including modelling of the observed phenomena in metal forming processes are also of interest.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Materials
