Reflecting the breadth of research in this area, the journal welcomes manuscripts about the development, metabolism, the regulation of mass and function, aging, degeneration, dystrophy and regeneration of skeletal muscle, with an emphasis on understanding adult skeletal muscle, its maintenance, and its interactions with non-muscle cell types and regulatory modulators. Main areas of interest include: -differentiation of skeletal muscle- atrophy and hypertrophy of skeletal muscle- aging of skeletal muscle- regeneration and degeneration of skeletal muscle- biology of satellite and satellite-like cells- dystrophic degeneration of skeletal muscle- energy and glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle- non-dystrophic genetic diseases of skeletal muscle, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and myopathies- maintenance of neuromuscular junctions- roles of ryanodine receptors and calcium signaling in skeletal muscle- roles of nuclear receptors in skeletal muscle- roles of GPCRs and GPCR signaling in skeletal muscle- other relevant aspects of skeletal muscle biology. In addition, articles on translational clinical studies that address molecular and cellular mechanisms of skeletal muscle will be published. Case reports are also encouraged for submission. Skeletal Muscle reflects the breadth of research on skeletal muscle and bridges gaps between diverse areas of science for example cardiac cell biology and neurobiology, which share common features with respect to cell differentiation, excitatory membranes, cell-cell communication, and maintenance. Suitable articles are model and mechanism-driven, and apply statistical principles where appropriate; purely descriptive studies are of lesser interest.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100203714&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100203714\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Further, the journal’s scope is restricted to areas of data management that are covered by the combined expertise of the journal’s editorial board. Submissions with a substantial theory component are welcome, but the VLDB Journal expects such submissions also to embody a systems component. In relation to data mining, the journal will handle submissions where systems issues play a significant role. Factors that we use to determine whether a data mining paper is within scope include: The submission targets systems issues in relation to data mining, e.g., by covering integration with a database engine or with other data management functionality. The submission’s contributions build on (rather than simply cite) work already published in database outlets, e.g., VLDBJ, ACM TODS, PVLDB, ACM SIGMOD, IEEE ICDE, EDBT. The journal's editorial board has the necessary expertise on the submission's topic. Traditional, stand-alone data mining papers that lack the above or similar characteristics are out of scope for this journal. Criteria similar to the above are applied to submission from other areas, e.g., information retrieval and geographical information systems.

The journal seeks to include submissions that take a critical approach towards all aspects of education and learning, digital media and digital technology - primarily from the perspective of the social sciences, humanities and arts. The journal has a long heritage in the areas of media education, media and cultural studies, film and television, communications studies, design studies and general education studies. As such, Learning, Media and Technology is not a generic ‘Ed Tech’ journal. We are not looking to publish context-free studies of individual technologies in individual institutional settings, ‘how-to’ guides for the practical use of technologies in the classroom, or speculation on the future potential of technology in education. Instead we invite submissions which build on contemporary debates such as: -The ways in which digital media interact with learning environments, educational institutions and educational cultures -The changing nature of knowledge, learning and pedagogy in the digital age -Digital media production, consumption and creativity in educational contexts -How digital media are shaping (and being shaped by) educational practices in local, national and global contexts -The social, cultural, economic and political nature of educational media and technology -The ways in which digital media in education interact with issues of democracy and equity, social justice and public good. Learning, Media and Technology analyses such questions from a global, interdisciplinary perspective in contributions of the very highest quality from scholars and practitioners in the social sciences, communication and media studies, cultural studies, philosophy, history as well as in the information and computer sciences","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Media Technology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=200147125&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=200147125\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The single most important criterion for acceptance in Development is scientific excellence. Research papers (articles and reports) should therefore pose and test a significant hypothesis or address a significant question, and should provide novel perspectives that advance our understanding of development. We also encourage submission of papers that use computational methods or mathematical models to obtain significant new insights into developmental biology topics. Manuscripts that are descriptive in nature will be considered only when they lay important groundwork for a field and/or provide novel resources for understanding developmental processes of broad interest to the community. Development includes a Techniques and Resources section for the publication of new methods, datasets, and other types of resources. Papers describing new techniques should include a proof-of-principle demonstration that the technique is valuable to the developmental biology community; they need not include in-depth follow-up analysis. The technique must be described in sufficient detail to be easily replicated by other investigators. Development will also consider protocol-type papers of exceptional interest to the community. We welcome submission of Resource papers, for example those reporting new databases, systems-level datasets, or genetic resources of major value to the developmental biology community. For all papers, the data or resource described must be made available to the community with minimal restrictions upon publication. To aid navigability, Development has dedicated sections of the journal to stem cells & regeneration and to human development. The criteria for acceptance into these sections is identical to those outlined above. Authors and editors are encouraged to nominate appropriate manuscripts for inclusion in one of these sections.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=14531&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=14531\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Modern systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated in their demand for performance, reliability and increasing autonomy. Historically, highly analytic and numeric-based methods have sufficed, frequently simplifying the problem to allow analytical tractability. Many manufactured and natural systems (biological, ecological and socio-economic) cannot be adequately represented or analyzed without requiring multiple interacting and interconnected frameworks and a common information-processing framework. A wide range of new theories, methodologies and techniques are required to ‘enable’ such systems, and thus engineering and integration to deal with these demands. IJSS therefore encourages original submissions in these areas, with special focus on papers that are strongly novel as well as not being overly applied. Proposals for special issues in cutting-edge areas of systems science are encouraged, and should be discussed with the Editor-in-Chief. Papers that cover those topics related to operations management and logistics will not be accepted for publication in IJSS. Instead they should be submitted directly to sister journal International Journal of Systems Science: Operations & Logistics. Queries regarding submissions can be made by contacting the Editor-in-Chief, whose decision is final.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science

The acquisition of good quality chemical data in environmental systems and the sound interpretation of this data is the basis for enhancing our understanding of the environment. TrEAC provides timely coverage of the novel and innovative use of analytical methods for the investigation of environmentally relevant substances and problems. Topics of interest include critical updates on the improvements in environmental analytical chemistry, achievements and challenges of modern techniques and possible future developments in the specific fields, such as sampling methodology, techniques for remote measurements, analytical instrumentation, miniaturization and automation, determination of trace atmospheric constituents of anthropogenic and natural origin, detection and identification of organic pollutants in water, soil and biota, determination and speciation of heavy metals and radionuclides in the environment, environmental references materials; method validation and chemometrics in environmental analysis. The aim of TrEAC is to publish concise reviews covering the latest advances in environmental analytical chemistry. Reviews should comprise about 4000 words and include several figures and tables. Reviews should interpret rather than be comprehensive. References should be limited to about 60. Primary research papers describing the results of the authors' research work are not within the scope of TrEAC. Please note that most articles published in the journal are by invitation of one of the Editors. If you wish to submit a paper to TrEAC and have not been invited by one of the Editors, please submit first a short proposal (max 1 page) to the Editor-in-Chief. All reviews will be subject to peer review and should be submitted through the Elsevier Editorial System.

It aims to provide a medium for communication among researchers as well as a channel linking researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. JCAL is also a rich source of material for master and PhD students in areas such as educational psychology, the learning sciences, instructional technology, instructional design, collaborative learning, intelligent learning systems, learning analytics, open, distance and networked learning, and educational evaluation and assessment. This is the case for formal (e.g., schools), non-formal (e.g., workplace learning) and informal learning (e.g., museums and libraries) situations and environments. Volumes often include one Special Issue which these provides readers with a broad and in-depth perspective on a specific topic. First published in 1985, JCAL continues to have the aim of making the outcomes of contemporary research and experience accessible. During this period there have been major technological advances offering new opportunities and approaches in the use of a wide range of technologies to support learning and knowledge transfer more generally. There is currently much emphasis on the use of network functionality and the challenges its appropriate uses pose to teachers/tutors working with students locally and at a distance. JCAL welcomes: -Empirical reports, single studies or programmatic series of studies on the use of computers and information technologies in learning and assessment -Critical and original meta-reviews of literature on the use of computers for learning -Empirical studies on the design and development of innovative technology-based systems for learning -Conceptual articles on issues relating to the

The following 11 areas are covered by Current Opinion in Insect Science. -Ecology -Insect genomics -Global Change Biology -Molecular Physiology (Including Immunity) -Pests and Resistance -Parasites, Parasitoids and Biological Control -Behavioural Ecology -Development and Regulation -Social Insects -Neuroscience -Vectors and Medical and Veterinary Entomology There is also a section that changes every year to reflect hot topics in the field. Section Editors, who are major authorities in their area, are appointed by the Editors of the journal. They divide their section into a number of topics, ensuring that the field is comprehensively covered and that all issues of current importance are emphasized. Section Editors commission articles from leading scientists on each topic that they have selected and the commissioned authors write short review articles in which they present recent developments in their subject, emphasizing the aspects that, in their opinion, are most important. In addition, they provide short annotations to the papers that they consider to be most interesting from all those published in their topic over the previous year.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100325079&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100325079\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Two interests frame the journal’s critical approach to research: (1) who benefits (and who does not) from current and historical social arrangements in education and, (2) from the standpoint of the least advantaged, what can be done about inequitable arrangements. Informed by this approach, articles published in the journal draw on post-structural, feminist, postcolonial and other critical orientations to critique education systems and to identify alternatives for education policy, practice and research.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700187630&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700187630\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It is a field that is highly transdisciplinary in nature, combining ideas, principles and methods of psychology, computer and internet technologies, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc. The goal of the International Journal of Cognitive Computing in Engineering is to explore how these data science technologies and new cognitive methods can be integrated to address real world engineering problems and challenges. For example, the journal welcomes submissions that look at the opportunities offered by combining existing data technologies with the knowledge of experts in the field and artificial intelligence. One of the benefits of cognitive computing is that it offers new analytics opportunities: the journal also welcomes designs for cognitive embedded data technologies that can process and analyse the large amount of data generated and aid decision-making. Submissions on a variety of cognitive computing-related topics will be considered.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Information Systems and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101101329&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101101329\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
