The transformation of biology from a largely descriptive, phenomenological discipline to one in which the regulatory principles can be understood and manipulated with predictability brings a new dimension to the study of cancer and the search for effective therapeutic modalities for this disease. Cancer and Metastasis Reviews provides a forum for critical review and discussion of these challenging developments. Each issue of Cancer and Metastasis Reviews is devoted to a particular theme or topic and will contain from five to seven different contributions. In addition, an introductory preface is included from an individual who is distinguished in the field to be covered. The topics and contributors are chosen by the Editor-in-Chief after consultation with various members of the Editorial Advisory Board. Special emphasis is placed on subjects which are of relevance to the molecular and cellular biology of cancer metastasis and tumor progression, as well as to the treatment of metastatic disease. Occasional issues will be devoted to an in-depth clinical and biological analysis of a particular type of cancer. A major function of the journal is to review some of the more important and interesting recent developments in the biology and treatment of malignant disease, as well as to highlight new and promising directions, be they technological or conceptual. Contributors are encouraged to review their personal work and be speculative.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oncology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28787&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=28787\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This includes the roles of CNS immune mediators (such as microglia and astrocytes, and their expressed cytokines and chemokines) as well as the roles of peripheral neuro-immune interactions, T cells, monocytes, complement proteins, acute phase proteins, oxidative injury and related molecular processes. Neuroinflammation is a rapidly expanding field that has revolutionized our understanding of chronic neurological diseases. This field has grown to encompass researchers with backgrounds in many diverse fields, including pathology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, clinical medicine, and epidemiology. Important contributions to this field have come from work with populations, patients, postmortem tissues, animal models, and in vitro systems. Journal of Neuroinflammation brings together work focusing on common pathogenic processes, and provides a forum for integrative reviews and commentaries on this field.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular

It publishes theoretical, conceptual and empirical research that explores one or more of the economic, social, cultural, political, organisational or environmental aspects of the subject. Critical views and perspectives are encouraged, as well as new ideas and approaches in relation to the theory and practice linking tourism and sustainability. Contributions can be from all disciplinary perspectives, with inter-disciplinary work especially welcome. Holistic and integrative work is encouraged. All geographical areas are included, as are all forms of tourism, both mass and niche market. Papers can be especially useful if they contribute new understanding and insights not just to the field of sustainable tourism but also to the wider social sciences or between the social and natural sciences. Many contributions include significant empirical evidence, but some innovate in the field by providing new perspectives, approaches and insights through critical reviews. The journal publishes Main Papers, Book Reviews, and occasional Opinion Pieces. Book reviews and Opinion Pieces are by invitation only. We also commission Special Issues – contact the editors if you have a proposal for a Special Issue or Opinion Piece.

Conversely, the journal will also publish articles whose primary focus deals with psychological processes and behavior, and which have relevance to one or more aspects of neuroscience. Submissions to the journal are actively encouraged which deal with topics not only in the more traditional areas, but also in the following areas, whenever the reviews bring new insights into brain-behavior relations: • Neuropsychology; • Cognitive neuroscience; • Brain imaging; • In vivo monitoring of the brain's electrical and biochemical activities; • Molecular biology; • Genetics; • Neurocomputation. Theoretical articles and mini-reviews, for which the scope and literature coverage are more restricted, will also be published. We do not publish empirical papers. We welcome review articles from clinical researchers whose submission exceeds the high quality threshold for the journal and significantly advances our understanding of a field.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Behavioral

It is published in association with the European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology. The journal publishes empirical reports, scholarly reviews and theoretical papers. It is directed at occupational health psychologists, work and organizational psychologists, those involved with organizational development, and all concerned with the interplay of work, health and organisations. Research published in Work & Stress relates psychologically salient features of the work environment to their psychological, behavioural and health consequences, focusing on the underlying psychological processes. The journal has become a natural home for research on the work-family interface, social relations at work (including topics such as bullying and conflict at work, leadership and organizational support), workplace interventions and reorganizations, and dimensions and outcomes of worker stress and well-being. Such dimensions and outcomes, both positive and negative, include stress, burnout, sickness absence, work motivation, work engagement and work performance. Of course, submissions addressing other topics in occupational health psychology are also welcomed.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15422&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15422\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Investigators in a wide range of disciplines increasingly require an appreciation of the significance of current biochemical and molecular biology advances while, members of the biochemical and molecular biology community itself seek concise information on advances in areas remote from their own specialties. Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology believes that well-written review articles prove an effective device for the integration and meaningful comprehension of vast, often contradictory, literature. Review articles also provide an opportunity for creative scholarship by synthesizing known facts, fruitful hypotheses, and new concepts. Accordingly, Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology publishes high-quality reviews that organize, evaluate, and present the current status of high-impact, current issues in the area of biochemistry and molecular biology. Topics are selected on the advice of an advisory board of outstanding scientists, who also suggest authors of special competence. The topics chosen are sufficiently broad to interest a wide audience of readers, yet focused enough to be within the competence of a single author.

The Editors welcome contributions from research, which consider sustainable management and conservation of resources. The journal emphasizes the transformation processes involved in a transition toward more sustainable production and consumption systems. Emphasis is upon technological, economic, institutional and policy aspects of specific resource management practices, such as conservation, recycling and resource substitution, and of \"systems-wide\" strategies, such as resource productivity improvement, the restructuring of production and consumption profiles and the transformation of industry. Contributions may have relevance at regional, national or international scales and may focus at any level of research from individual resources or technologies to whole sectors or systems of interest. Contributors may emphasise any of the aforementioned aspects as well as scientific and methodological issues. However, manuscripts that consider only laboratory experiments, without a discussion of the practical, environmental and economic implications of the presented research, are excluded from publication in the journal.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=26424&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=26424\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In particular, GEB welcomes studies that use macroecological methods, comparative analyses, meta-analyses, reviews, spatial analyses and modelling to arrive at general, conceptual conclusions. Studies in GEB need not be global in spatial extent, but the conclusions and implications of the study must be relevant to ecologists and biogeographers globally, rather than being limited to local areas, or specific taxa. Similarly, GEB is not limited to spatial studies; we are equally interested in the general patterns of nature through time, among taxa (e.g., body sizes, dispersal abilities), through the course of evolution, etc. Further, GEB welcomes papers that investigate general impacts of human activities on ecological systems in accordance with the above criteria.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology,

It is closely akin to machine learning, and also finds applications in fast emerging areas such as biometrics, bioinformatics, multimedia data analysis and most recently data science. The journal Pattern Recognition was established some 50 years ago, as the field emerged in the early years of computer science. Over the intervening years it has expanded considerably. The journal accepts papers making original contributions to the theory, methodology and application of pattern recognition in any area, provided that the context of the work is both clearly explained and grounded in the pattern recognition literature. Papers whos primary concern falls outside the pattern recognition domain and which report routine applications of it using existing or well known methods, should be directed elsewhere. The publication policy is to publish (1) new original articles that have been appropriately reviewed by competent scientific people, (2) reviews of developments in the field, and (3) pedagogical papers covering specific areas of interest in pattern recognition. Various special issues will be organized from time to time on current topics of interest to Pattern Recognition. Submitted papers should be single column, double spaced, no less than 20 and no more than 35 (40 for a review) pages long, with numbered pages.

HRMJ seeks to publish scholarly articles on any aspect of employment studies but especially those focused on issues related to the management of people at work. Articles should make a substantive contribution to theory development on contemporary issues, incorporate rigorous use of theory and research, and offer well-founded conclusions with practical implications. Authors are encouraged to avoid the inherent biases of cross-sectional or single-source data, however, where such an approach can be justified through an appropriate research model or the potential for a novel theoretical contribution, such empirical studies will be considered provided sufficient steps have been taken to limit any potential bias. The journal is particularly interested in articles that will appeal to an international readership. Critical reviews are also welcomed, especially those pointing to how theory and practice can be developed further.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=3600148105&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=3600148105\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Original Research Papers published in Ecological Monographs will continue to document complex observational, experimental, or theoretical studies that by their very integrated nature defy dissolution into shorter publications focused on a single topic or message. Reviews will be comprehensive and synthetic papers that establish new benchmarks in the field, define directions for future research, contribute to fundamental understanding of ecological principles, and derive principles for ecological management in its broadest sense (including, but not limited to: conservation, mitigation, restoration, and pro-active protection of the environment). Reviews should reflect the full development of a topic and encompass relevant natural history, observational and experimental data, analyses, models, and theory. Reviews published in Ecological Monographs should further blur the boundaries between “basic” and “applied” ecology. Concepts and Synthesis papers will conceptually advance the field of ecology. These papers are expected to go well beyond works being reviewed and include discussion of new directions, new syntheses, and resolutions of old questions. In this world of rapid scientific advancement and never-ending environmental change, there needs to be room for the thoughtful integration of scientific ideas, data, and concepts that feeds the mind and guides the development of the maturing science of ecology. Ecological Monographs provides that room, with an expansive view to a sustainable future.

The mission of CMGH is to publish impactful digestive biology research that ranges from mechanisms of normal function to pathobiology and covers a broad spectrum of themes in gastroenterology, hepatology, and pancreatology. The journal reports the latest advances in cell biology, immunology, physiology, microbiology, genetics, and neurobiology of gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic health and disease. The research CMGH publishes is hypothesis driven, mechanistically novel, and appropriately designed and powered. Studies published in CMGH address important questions and use in vitro models, tissues or cells from patients, and animal models to make fundamental discoveries and translate them to human disease. CMGH is primarily for basic and translational researchers. By providing a rigorous central forum for high quality digestive biology, CMGH ensures that this group, which includes trainees, new investigators, and established investigators, has access to a spectrum of outstanding work in one location. In an effort to distribute its content to the widest audience possible, CMGH is open access. The web-accessible digital platform is maximized by inclusion of graphical abstracts, large data sets, and video microscopy, endoscopy, and whole animal imaging approaches. Content can also be accessed via a dedicated app. CMGH is presently published 8 times each year, and will move to a monthly publication over time. Reviews are handled fairly and rapidly by the Editors with assistance of an expert editorial board and external reviews. Following rigorous peer review, accepted manuscripts are available online within days of the final decision.
