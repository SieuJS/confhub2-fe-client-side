Information, Communication & Society (iCS) transcends cultural and geographical boundaries as it explores a diverse range of issues relating to the development and application of information and communications technologies (ICTs), asking such questions as: -What are the new and evolving forms of social software? What direction will these forms take? -ICTs facilitating globalization and how might this affect conceptions of local identity, ethnic differences, and regional sub-cultures? -Are ICTs leading to an age of electronic surveillance and social control? What are the implications for policing criminal activity, citizen privacy and public expression? -How are ICTs affecting daily life and social structures such as the family, work and organization, commerce and business, education, health care, and leisure activities? -To what extent do the virtual worlds constructed using ICTs impact on the construction of objects, spaces, and entities in the material world? iCS analyses such questions from a global, interdisciplinary perspective in contributions of the very highest quality from scholars and practitioners in the social sciences, gender and cultural studies, communication and media studies, as well as in the information and computer sciences.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Library and Information Sciences","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=200147110&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=200147110\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary in scope, it aims to expedite the translation of scientific discovery into new or improved standards of care and promotes a wide-ranging exchange between basic, preclinical, clinical, epidemiologic, and health outcomes research. It encourages submission of studies describing preclinical research with potential for application to human disease, and studies describing research obtained from preliminary human experimentation with potential to refine the understanding of biological principles underpinning human disease. Also encouraged are studies describing public health research with potential for application to the clinic, disease prevention, or healthcare policy.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry

Articles are written by international specialists in the field, discussing such complex issues as distinctive functional features of central nervous system disease and injury; challenges in early diagnosis; the impact of genes and environment on function; risk factors for functional impairment; treatment efficacy of neuropsychological rehabilitation; the role of neuroimaging, neuroelectrophysiology, and other neurometric modalities in explicating function; clinical trial design; neuropsychological function and its substrates characteristic of normal development and aging; and neuropsychological dysfunction and its substrates in neurological, psychiatric, and medical conditions. The journal's broad perspective is supported by an outstanding, multidisciplinary editorial review board guided by the aim to provide students and professionals, clinicians and researchers with scholarly articles that critically and objectively summarize and synthesize the strengths and weaknesses in the literature and propose novel hypotheses, methods of analysis, and links to other fields.

Contextual Behavioral Science is a systematic and pragmatic approach to the understanding of behavior, the solution of human problems, and the promotion of human growth and development. Contextual Behavioral Science uses functional principles and theories to analyze and modify action embedded in its historical and situational context. The goal is to predict and influence behavior, with precision, scope, and depth, across all behavioral domains and all levels of analysis, so as to help create a behavioral science that is more adequate to the challenge of the human condition. Contextual behavioral science is a strategic approach to the analysis of human behavior that proposes the need for a multi-level (e.g. social factors, neurological factors, behavioral factors) and multi-method (e.g., time series analyses, cross-sectional, experimentalâ¦) exploration of contextual and manipulable variables relevant to the prediction and influence of human behavior. The journal considers papers relevant to a contextual behavioral approach including: -Empirical studies (without topical restriction - e.g., clinical psychology, psychopathology, education, organizational psychology, etc.) -Brief reports on preliminary, but provocative findings -Reviews (systematic reviews and meta-analyses are preferred) and -Conceptual and philosophical papers on contextual behavioral science","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied

Published bi-monthly, each issue combines original articles and reviews providing an invaluable reference for any specialist concerned with these fields. Nutrition and nutritional care have gained wide clinical and scientific interest during the past decades. The increasing knowledge of metabolic disturbances and nutritional assessment in chronic and acute diseases has stimulated rapid advances in design, development and clinical application of nutritional support. The aims of ESPEN are to encourage the rapid diffusion of knowledge and its application in the field of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition or, more broadly, Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. Being the journal of ESPEN with members from various interests, either focused on basic research or clinical disciplines, the journal reflects the scientific nature of this multidisciplinary background and encourages the coordination of investigation and research from these disciplines. The journal publishes guidelines, consensus statements, original articles, short communications, letters to the Editor and review papers on those factors in acute and chronic diseases, which have metabolic and nutritional implications. It also publishes scientific works related to the development of new techniques and their application in the field of clinical nutrition.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Nutrition and Dietetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=30050&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=30050\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Because of the multifaceted nature of this challenge, papers can be based on a wide range of approaches. Thus, manuscripts may vary from physiological, genetics, life-history, and behavioural perspectives for organismal studies to community and biogeochemical studies when the goal is to understand ecosystem and larger scale ecological phenomena. We believe that the diverse nature of our journal is a strength, not a weakness, and we are open-minded about the variety of data, research approaches and types of studies that we publish. Certain key areas will continue to be emphasized: studies that integrate genomics with ecology, studies that examine how key aspects of physiology (e.g., stress) impact the ecology of animals and plants, or vice versa, and how evolution shapes interactions among function and ecological traits. Ecology has increasingly moved towards the realization that organismal traits and activities are vital for understanding community dynamics and ecosystem processes, particularly in response to the rapid global changes occurring in earthâs environment, and Functional Ecology aims to publish such integrative papers.
