We welcome all original submissions that further our understanding of the urban condition and the rapid changes taking place in cities and regions across the globe, whether from an empirical, theoretical, or a policy perspective. In addition to research articles, Urban Studies publishes peer-reviewed critical commentaries and book reviews besides a regular series of Special Issues. The journal is also committed to developing Social Media as the means of informing debates about the contemporary urban condition.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29684&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29684\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Methods and Algorithms for Scientific Computing: Papers in this category may include theoretical analysis, provided that the relevance to applications in science and engineering is demonstrated. They should contain meaningful computational results and theoretical results or strong heuristics supporting the performance of new algorithms. 2. Computational Methods in Science and Engineering: Papers in this section will typically describe novel methodologies for solving a specific problem in computational science or engineering. They should contain enough information about the application to orient other computational scientists but should omit details of interest mainly to the applications specialist. 3. Software and High-Performance Computing: Papers in this category should concern the novel design and development of computational methods and high-quality software, parallel algorithms, high-performance computing issues, new architectures, data analysis, or visualization. The primary focus should be on computational methods that have potentially large impact for an important class of scientific or engineering problems.

A primary aim of the journal is to publish articles detailing novel and important work that will challenge the way animal ecologists think. We encourage papers that make significant advances to the field through the development of ecological theory or methodology which generate ecological insights that extend beyond the study system utilised. Studies focussed on a single species are considered for publication when they make a significant contribution to advancing general theory or understanding. A theoretical paper in Journal of Animal Ecology should establish, or substantially extend, our theoretical understanding of an issue of general importance for the field of animal ecology. The best theory papers will have a close relationship to considerations of how empirical analysis can be tensioned against the new theoretical developments.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=29544&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=29544\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Within this setting CPC publishes two types of paper. Programs in Physics (CPiP) These papers describe significant computer programs to be archived in the CPC Program Library which is held in the Mendeley Data repository. The submitted software must be covered by an approved open source licence. Papers and associated computer programs that address a problem of contemporary interest in physics that cannot be solved by current software are particularly encouraged. Computational Physics Papers (CP) These are research papers in, but are not limited to, the following themes across computational physics and related disciplines. mathematical and numerical methods and algorithms; computational models including those associated with the design, control and analysis of experiments; and algebraic computation. Each will normally include software implementation and performance details. The software implementation should, ideally, be available via GitHub, Zenodo or an institutional repository.In addition, research papers on the impact of advanced computer architecture and special purpose computers on computing in the physical sciences and software topics related to, and of importance in, the physical sciences may be considered.

The emphasis of this journal is on publication of information of relevance to the use of assessment measures, including test development, validation, and interpretation practices. The scope of the journal includes research that can inform assessment practices in mental health, forensic, medical, and other applied settings. Papers that focus on the assessment of cognitive and neuropsychological functioning, personality, and psychopathology are invited. Most papers published in Assessment report the results of original empirical research, however integrative review articles and scholarly case studies will also be considered. Papers focusing on a) new assessment methodologies and techniques for both researchers and practitioners, b) how assessment methods and research informs understanding of major issues in clinical psychology such as the structure, classification, and mechanisms of psychopathology, and c) multi-method assessment research and the integration of assessment methods in research and practice are of particular interest. The journal also encourages submissions introducing useful, novel, and non-redundant instruments or demonstrating how existing instruments have applicability in new research or applied contexts. All submissions should provide strong rationales for their efforts and articulate important implications for assessment science and/or practice.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Clinical Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=12058&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=12058\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

EMJ articles challenge the status quo through critically informed empirical and theoretical investigations, and present the latest thinking and innovative research on major management topics, while still being accessible and interesting to non-specialists. EMJ articles are characterized by their intellectual curiosity and diverse methodological approaches, which lead to contributions that impact profoundly on management theory and practice. We welcome interdisciplinary research that synthesizes distinct research traditions to shed new light on contemporary challenges in the broad domain of European business and management.

Ranked among the top 33% of journals in both Orthopedics and Sports Sciences, the goal of this European journal is to publish papers about innovative knee surgery, sports trauma surgery and arthroscopy. Each issue features a series of peer-reviewed articles that deal with diagnosis and management and with basic research. Each issue also contains at least one review article about an important clinical problem. Case presentations or short notes about technical innovations are also accepted for publication. The articles cover all aspects of knee surgery and all types of sports trauma; in addition, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention, and all types of arthroscopy (not only the knee but also the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, ankle, etc.) are addressed. Articles on new diagnostic techniques such as MRI and ultrasound and high-quality articles about the biomechanics of joints, muscles and tendons are included. Although this is largely a clinical journal, it is also open to basic research with clinical relevance. Because the journal is supported by a distinguished European Editorial Board, assisted by an international Advisory Board, you can be assured that the journal maintains the highest standards.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports

Through both a peer reviewed journal and an editor reviewed companion website, we publish articles, essays, interviews, forums, and book reviews that examine social struggles over access to and control of space, place, territory, region, and resources. We seek contributions that investigate and challenge the ways that modes and systems of power, difference and oppression differentially shape lives, and how those modes and systems are resisted, subverted and reworked. We welcome work that is empirically engaged and furthers a range of critical epistemological approaches, that pushes conceptual boundaries and puts theory to work in innovative ways, and that consciously navigates the fraught politics of knowledge production within and beyond the academy.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=13274&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=13274\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal provides a place for the publication of critical reviews of the current knowledge and understanding of environmental sciences in order to provide insight into contaminant pathways, fate and behavior in environmental compartments and the possible consequences of their presence, with multidisciplinary contributions from the fields of analytical chemistry, biochemistry, biology, ecology, molecular and cellular biology (in an environmental context), and human, wildlife and environmental toxicology. This journal does not typically consider submissions dealing with technical aspects of occupational exposure and effects in humans, wastewater treatment and effluent characterization, or remediation of contaminated sites. However, submissions addressing one of these topic areas may be considered where there exists a strong link to the receiving environment, and/or the identification of emerging contaminants of concern. All manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field. Reviewers will be asked to consider coverage and critical appraisal of the subject, originality , relevance, and impact to the wider scientific community. Authors writing English as a second language are encouraged to have their manuscript edited by a primary English language speaker or by a professional editing firm.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health, Toxicology and

All papers submitted to the journal must show a distinctive link with environmental management applications. Specific area of interest for the journal include: • Development of technologies intended for applications to environmental ecosystems (water, air, soil) • Natural resource management • Ecological applications or conservation • Management and valorisation of waste (including industrial residues and effluents) • Development of methods for environmental quality management (new procedures, characterization techniques, monitoring methods, governing standards, etc.) • Environmental system modelling and optimization • Environmental analysis and assessment (environmental impact assessment, risk assessment, life cycle analysis, material flow analysis, life cycle costing, emission accounting, etc.) • Social, economic and policy aspects of environmental management Case studies are welcome when the authors indicate the wider applications of their insights or techniques, emphasizing the global perspective of the problem they address. As governments and the general public become more keenly aware of the critical issues arising from how humans use their environment, this journal provides a forum for the discussion of environmental problems around the world and for the presentation of management results. It is aimed not only at the environmental manager, but at anyone concerned with the sustainable use of environmental resources.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental

Papers published in JBC can therefore fall under the umbrellas of not only biological chemistry, chemical biology, or biochemistry, but also allied disciplines such as biophysics, systems biology, RNA biology, immunology, microbiology, neurobiology, epigenetics, computational biology, ’omics, and many more. The outcome of our focus on papers that contribute novel and important mechanistic insights, rather than on a particular topic area, is that JBC is truly a melting pot for scientists across disciplines. In addition, JBC welcomes papers that describe methods that will help scientists push their biochemical inquiries forward and resources that will be of use to the research community.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=17592&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

The objective of the journal is to cut across the boundaries of established sciences and achieve an interdisciplinary view of these interactions. Experimental, conceptual, and modelling approaches are welcome. With the above objective, Biogeosciences covers the following fields: biodiversity and ecosystem function; evolutionary ecology; environmental microbiology; biogeochemistry and global elemental cycles; biogeochemistry and gas exchange; plant–soil interactions; biomineralization, microbial weathering, and sedimentation; interactions between microbes, organic matter sediments, and rocks; biogeophysics; Earth system sciences and response to global changes; palaeogeobiology, including origin and evolution of life, evolution of the biosphere, sedimentary records, and the development and use of proxies; astrobiology and exobiology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth-Surface Processes","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=130037&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=130037\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This includes laboratory-based experimental studies with healthy, at risk and subclinical individuals that inform clinical application as well as studies with clinically severe samples. The following types of submissions are encouraged: theoretical reviews of mechanisms that contribute to psychopathology and that offer new treatment targets; tests of novel, mechanistically focused psychological interventions, especially ones that include theory-driven or experimentally-derived predictors, moderators and mediators; and innovations in dissemination and implementation of evidence-based practices into clinical practice in psychology and associated fields, especially those that target underlying mechanisms or focus on novel approaches to treatment delivery. In addition to traditional psychological disorders, the scope of the journal includes behavioural medicine (e.g., chronic pain).

In accordance with the mission of the College, the journal focuses on clinical and basic science contributions that advance our understanding of brain function and human behaviour and enable translation into improved treatments and enhanced public health impact in psychiatry. Recent years have been characterized by exciting advances in basic knowledge and available experimental techniques in neuroscience and genomics. However, clinical translation of these findings has not been as rapid. The journal aims to narrow this gap by promoting findings that are expected to have a major impact on both our understanding of the biological bases of mental disorders and the development and improvement of treatments, ideally paving the way for prevention and recovery.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biological
