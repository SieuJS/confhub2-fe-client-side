Its mission is to publish leading edge innovative research that significantly advances the field of project management and organizing. Published eight times a year it presents new knowledge on areas such as managing projects, programs and portfolios, project-based/oriented organizations, project networks, and project-oriented societies. It is dedicated to project management and organizing from the perspectives of organizational behavior, strategy, change, and innovation. Methodologically, IJPM covers the full range of empirically-based modes of enquiry using appropriate research frameworks, provided they demonstrate generic insights of significant value to project management. IJPM does not categorically exclude certain empirical methodologies, except however purely mathematical modeling or operations research pieces. Irrespective of the mode of enquiry or methods used, the key methodological issues in new submissions are: appropriateness of methodology to the research task, clarity in how the study has been carried out, rigor in the application of the methods, and consideration of relevant validity issues. Papers are also expected to explicitly build on current debates in recent literature and to contribute to theory. Occasionally IJPM publishes conceptual papers which fulfill a high-quality standard.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International

RCR Advances strives to implement a high standard and rapid peer review process to ensure timely and high-quality communications on emerging resource management and sustainability topics. The journal is a companion journal to the highly reputed journal Resources, Conservation & Recycling. The Editors welcome contributions covering technological, economic, institutional, and/or policy aspects of resources management practices, such as conservation, recycling, recovery, substitution, and \"systems-wide\" strategies. Manuscripts using multi- or inter-disciplinary approaches, targeting broader readership, or addressing emerging resource sustainability issues are of particular interest. Contributions may have relevance at local/regional, national, or international scales and may focus at any level of research from individual resources or technologies to whole sectors or systems of interest. However, contributions that are based only on laboratory experiments, without a discussion on broader implications of the presented research, are outside the scope of the journal. The journal considers full length research articles, critical reviews, short communications, commentaries, forums, and news & views for publication.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101081525&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101081525\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The mutually reinforcing components in this pursuit are the development of positive theories and the testing of their empirical implications. Although this paradigm has been associated with many advances in the understanding of politics, no leading journal of political science is dedicated primarily to the publication of positive political science. The Quarterly Journal of Political Science will solicit, review, and publish the highest quality manuscripts in positive political science and contemporary political economy. The substantive content of the journal will be broad and eclectic, including cutting-edge research on any aspect of private, local, national, comparative, or international politics. The methodological approach will be analytical, focusing on positive political theories, empirical tests of those theories, and the measurement of causal relationships. In their commitment to making the Journal the premier interdisciplinary publication of scientific research on politics, the editors welcome submissions not only from political scientists but also from scholars in cognate disciplines such as economics, business, and law.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11600153640&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11600153640\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal normally publishes only articles that involve the analysis of substantive problems related to the reliability of complex systems or present techniques and/or theoretical results that have a discernable relationship to the solution of such problems. An important aim is to achieve a balance between academic material and practical applications. The following topics are within the scope of the journal: methods for reliability and probabilistic safety assessment; model and parameter uncertainties; aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, sensitivity analysis, data collection and analysis; engineering judgement and expert opinions; human reliability; test and maintenance policies; models for ageing and life extension; systems analysis of the impact of earthquakes, fires, tornadoes, winds, floods, etc.; codes, standards and safety criteria; operator decision support systems; software reliability; methods and applications of automatic fault detection and diagnosis; dynamic reliability; design and evaluation of man machine systems and human interfaces; design innovation for safety and reliability; safety culture; accident investigation and management. The journal does not normally publish articles that involve fuzzy sets and related non-probabilistic methods unless they contribute significantly to the solution of substantive problems related to the analysis of real systems. The journal will contain contributed material in the form of original research papers, review articles, industrial case studies, safety recommendations, and short communications.

It is the leading digital health journal globally in terms of quality/visibility (Impact Factor 2018: 4.945, ranked #1 out of 26 journals in the medical informatics category) and in terms of size (number of papers published). The journal focuses on emerging technologies, medical devices, apps, engineering, and informatics applications for patient education, prevention, population health and clinical care. As a leading high-impact journal in its disciplines (health informatics and health services research), it is selective, but it is now complemented by almost 30 specialty JMIR sister journals, which have a broader scope. Peer-review reports are portable across JMIR journals and papers can be transferred, so authors save time by not having to resubmit a paper to different journals. As an open access journal, we are read by clinicians, allied health professionals, informal caregivers, and patients alike, and have (as with all JMIR journals) a focus on readable and applied science reporting the design and evaluation of health innovations and emerging technologies. We publish original research, viewpoints, and reviews (both literature reviews and medical device/technology/app reviews).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health Informatics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23709&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23709\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

They may occur in conjunction with other major natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Expanding urbanization and changing land-use practices have increased the incidence of landslide disasters. Landslides as catastrophic events include human injury, loss of life and economic devastation and are studied as part of the fields of earth, water and engineering sciences. The aim of the journal Landslides is to be the common platform for the publication of integrated research on landslide processes, hazards, risk analysis, mitigation, and the protection of our cultural heritage and the environment.

Acceptance decisions are based on the originality and quality of the research and its prospective interest to a wide readership. Papers submitted to The FEBS Journal should provide novel perspectives on a biologically relevant problem and be of interest to a broad readership. The scope of the Journal is broad and inclusive. We are particularly interested in papers in which state-of-the-art approaches are applied to bring novel insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the functions of molecules, cells and organisms. The Journal also welcomes manuscripts of an interdisciplinary nature, including systems approaches that address fundamental concepts in molecular, cellular or organismal biology. The Journal does not accept papers that lack biological insight. Papers describing bioinformatic analysis, modelling or structural studies of specific systems or molecules should include experimental data. The FEBS Journal also publishes Reviews, Minireviews, Viewpoints and Snapshots on a wide range of topics. These pieces are specially commissioned by our Editorial team and are selected on the basis of their interest to a wide readership.

It draws contributions in the form of major synoptic papers and syntheses or meta-analyses that lay out new approaches, re-examine existing findings, methods or theory, and discuss papers and commentaries from diverse areas. Focal areas include fish palaeontology, molecular biology and ecology, genetics, biochemistry, physiology, ecology, behaviour, evolutionary studies, conservation, assessment, population dynamics, mathematical modelling, ecosystem analysis and the social, economic and policy aspects of fisheries where they are grounded in a scientific approach. A paper in Fish and Fisheries must draw upon all key elements of the existing literature on a topic, normally have a broad geographic and/or taxonomic scope, and provide general points which make it compelling to a wide range of readers whatever their geographical location. So, in short, we aim to publish articles that make syntheses of old or synoptic, long-term or spatially widespread data, introduce or consolidate fresh concepts or theory, or, in the Ghoti section, briefly justify preliminary, new synoptic ideas.

Papers are encouraged that report substantial “progress” such as gains in independently certified solar cell efficiency, eligible for a new entry in the journal's widely referenced Solar Cell Efficiency Tables. Examples of papers that will not be considered for publication are those that report development in materials without relation to data on cell performance, routine analysis, characterisation or modelling of cells or processing sequences, routine reports of system performance, improvements in electronic hardware design, or country programs, although invited papers may occasionally be solicited in these areas to capture accumulated “progress”.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27540&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=27540\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Ecological economics is an interdisciplinary field defined by a set of concrete problems or challenges related to governing economic activity in a way that promotes human well-being, sustainability, and justice. The journal thus emphasizes critical work that draws on and integrates elements of ecological science, economics, and the analysis of values, behaviors, cultural practices, institutional structures, and societal dynamics. The journal is transdisciplinary in spirit and methodologically open, drawing on the insights offered by a variety of intellectual traditions, and appealing to a diverse readership. Specific research areas covered include: valuation of natural resources, sustainable agriculture and development, ecologically integrated technology, integrated ecologic-economic modelling at scales from local to regional to global, implications of thermodynamics for economics and ecology, renewable resource management and conservation, critical assessments of the basic assumptions underlying current economic and ecological paradigms and the implications of alternative assumptions, economic and ecological consequences of genetically engineered organisms, and gene pool inventory and management, alternative principles for valuing natural wealth, integrating natural resources and environmental services into national income and wealth accounts, methods of implementing efficient environmental policies, case studies of economic-ecologic conflict or harmony, etc. New issues in this area are rapidly emerging and will find a ready forum in Ecological Economics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics

Technological innovation and internet-mediated interaction raise both challenges and opportunities for public policy: whether in areas that have received much work already (e.g. digital divides, digital government, and privacy) or newer areas, like regulation of data-intensive technologies and platforms, the rise of precarious labour, and regulatory responses to misinformation and hate speech. We welcome innovative research in areas where the Internet already impacts public policy, where it raises new challenges or dilemmas, or provides opportunities for policy that is smart and equitable. While we welcome perspectives from any academic discipline, we look particularly for insight that can feed into social science disciplines like political science, public administration, economics, sociology, and communication. We welcome articles that introduce methodological innovation, theoretical development, or rigorous data analysis concerning a particular question or problem of public policy.

Focusing on the dynamics of public policy in Europe, the journal encourages a wide range of social science approaches, both qualitative and quantitative. JEPP defines European public policy widely and welcomes innovative ideas and approaches. The main areas covered by the Journal are as follows: -theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of public policy in Europe and elsewhere -national public policy developments and processes in Europe -comparative studies of public policy within Europe -the public policy interface between nation states and the EU -the EU: its institutions, political processes and policies -the EU as an actor in regional and global affairs. In addition, JEPP publishes a Research Agenda Section and a Debate Section (edited by Michael Blauberger, University of Salzburg, Austria). Contributions to the Research Agenda Section are expected to review the state of the art in a particular field of interest and develop an innovative research agenda. The Debate Section comprises two or three brief articles, which take contrary or complementary standpoints on a common issue. The short debate format is meant to particularly encourage submissions on topical and controversial issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19878&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19878\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal is linked to the European Sociological Association and its aims and objectives. As a direct consequence of this link, the journal contributes to plurality and openness within the discipline of sociology. It also observes high ethical standards in academic independence and the double-blind review of submitted articles. European Societies publishes research from every part of the planet on all aspects of European social life and socioculture. It welcomes all sociological methods and all approaches in sociological theory. The focus is on addressing the specific contribution of contemporary European societies to the global condition, as well as on the serious socioeconomic and socio-political challenges that European societies face. Articles may address these themes in a historical perspective. Comparative research involving Europe as a whole or specific European countries makes for a significant part of the publications. The journal also welcomes comparisons with societies beyond Europe. Although epistemically anchored in sociology, European Societies welcomes contributions from any discipline, provided that they substantially advance sociological knowledge on Europe or extensively exploit that knowledge to the benefit of other epistemic fields.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Demography","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=14424&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=14424\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers in sensing, sensors, mechanical design, computing architectures, communication, planning, learning, and control, applied to field applications are encouraged. The Journal focuses on experimental robotics and encourages publication of work that has both theoretical and practical significance. Authors will be encouraged to implement their work and demonstrate its utility on significant problems with emphasis on the underlying principles. That is, the Journal will encourage reporting on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely on what was done. Also encouraged are comparative or meta-studies and verification of previously published results as well as reports of extended field experiments that seek to validate autonomous systems in representative environments. Systems papers will be welcome but they must include analysis and insight into why approaches work and the challenges still to be addressed. Studies of systems that have been fielded over extended durations are encouraged. The journal will publish only articles of high quality rather than achieving a particular number of papers or a ratio of accepted papers to those submitted.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Science Applications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Systems Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4700152301&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=4700152301\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Theoretical, analytical, experimental, empirical, historical, and descriptive approaches are all appropriate, though preference is given to research and synthesis that leads to generalizations potentially applicable to other species, populations, communities, or ecosystems. Included within the journal are papers on physiological responses of individual organisms to their biotic and abiotic environments, ecological genetics and evolution, the structure and dynamics of populations, interactions among individuals of the same or different species, the behavior of individuals and groups of organisms, the organization of biological communities, landscape ecology, and ecosystems processes. Papers reporting ecological research on all kinds of organisms and ecosystems are welcome. New methodologies with a potential for broad use in ecology are also of interest. Papers that are well grounded in ecological theory and have broad implications for environmental policy or resource management may be well suited for publication in Ecological Applications, but are also welcome in Ecology if they meet the general criteria described above.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=20308&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=20308\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

From such concerns, a new literature is emerging that seeks to reformulate corporate, social, and political activity, and the theoretical and practical means by which we apprehend and affect that activity. Research Areas Include: • Studies involving the political economy of accounting, critical accounting, radical accounting, and accounting's implication in the exercise of power • Financial accounting's role in the processes of international capital formation, including its impact on stock market stability and international banking activities • Management accounting's role in organizing the labor process • The relationship between accounting and the state in various social formations • Studies of accounting's historical role, as a means of \"remembering\" the subject's social and conflictual character • The role of accounting in establishing \"real\" democracy at work and other domains of life • Accounting's adjudicative function in international exchanges, such as that of the Third World debt • Antagonisms between the social and private character of accounting, such as conflicts of interest in the audit process • The identification of new constituencies for radical and critical accounting information • Accounting's involvement in gender and class conflicts in the workplace • The interplay between accounting, social conflict, industrialization, bureaucracy, and technocracy • Reappraisals of the role of accounting as a science and technology • Critical reviews of \"useful\" scientific knowledge about

We aim to promote wider data sharing and reuse, and to credit those that share. Scientific Data primarily publishes Data Descriptors, a new type of publication that provides detailed descriptions of research datasets, including the methods used to collect the data and technical analyses supporting the quality of the measurements. Data Descriptors focus on helping others reuse data, rather than testing hypotheses, or presenting new interpretations, methods or in-depth analyses. Scientific Data also welcomes submissions describing analyses or meta-analyses of existing data, and original articles on systems, technologies and techniques that advance data sharing and reuse to support reproducible research. Scientific Data offers a streamlined but thorough peer-review process that evaluates the rigour and quality of the experiments used to generate the data and the completeness of the description of the data. The actual data are stored in one or more public, community-recognized repositories, and release of the data is verified as a condition of publication. Scientific Data is open to submissions from a broad range of natural science disciplines, including, but not limited to, data from the life, biomedical and environmental science communities. Submissions may describe big or small data, from new experiments or value-added aggregations of existing data, from major consortiums and single labs. We are also willing to consider descriptions of quantitative datasets from the social sciences, particularly those that may be of use for integrative analyses that stretch across the traditional discipline boundaries between the life, biomedical, environmental and social sciences.
