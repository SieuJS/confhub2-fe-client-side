Without packaging, the processing of food can become compromised as it is contaminated by direct contact with physical, chemical, and biological contaminants. In recent years, the development of novel food packaging (modified atmosphere & active packaging) has not only increased the shelf life of foods, but also their safety and quality - therefore bringing convenience to consumers. Directly related, and interlinked, with food packaging is the concept of shelf life - the length of time that foods, beverages, pharmaceutical drugs, chemicals, and many other perishable items are given before they are considered unsuitable for sale, use, or consumption.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomaterials","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology (medical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Polymers and Plastics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100285075&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100285075\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Research papers or papers of expository type are considered for publication. This journal was founded in 1871 with the initial aim of publishing the best dissertations of students of the Scuola Normale, along with sporadic contributions from outside. A second series was commenced in 1932 by Leonida Tonelli, under whom the Annali became a research periodical in pure and applied mathematics. After a brief pause due to the war and the death of Tonelli, a third series was started in 1947 by Alessandro Faedo, and a fourth one in 1974 under the direction of Guido Stampacchia, and later of Edoardo Vesentini, Enrico Arbarello, and Giuseppe Tomassini. A fifth series was initiated in 2002. It was initially directed by Giuseppe Tomassini, and currently it is by Umberto Zannier. Papers are usually in English, and they are published after having been peer-reviewed by referees chosen by the Editor in chief, the scientific secretaries, and the Editorial Board.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Theoretical Computer Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4700151702&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=4700151702\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Our ultimate goal is a rigorous and relevant global theory of corporate governance. We define corporate governance broadly as the exercise of power over corporate entities so as to increase the value provided to the organization's various stakeholders, as well as making those stakeholders accountable for acting responsibly with regard to the protection, generation, and distribution of wealth invested in the firm. Because of this broad conceptualization, a wide variety of academic disciplines can contribute to our understanding, and we do not limit our perspective to any one theory or methodological paradigm. Previous theory and research has been published by scholars operating from such base disciplines as accounting, economics, finance, law, management, sociology, and political science. In other words, we seek to learn about both the antecedents and effects of corporate governance practices, policies, and principles throughout the world from an interdisciplinary “conversation”.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business, Management and Accounting

The JMM explicitly desires to see all paradigmatic traditions contribute to debates on marketing theory and practice. This includes traditional, predominantly managerial contributions aligned with logical empiricist perspectives, through to interpretive and Consumer Culture Theoretic (CCT) reflections on marketing's role in providing the resources for identity building and self-affirmation, as well as the negative ramifications of consumption on individuals and communities.

Articles can be specific to a single sub-discipline of psychology or have relevance to the entire field. We encourage the integration and adaption of methods, methodologies and analytic approaches from one area of psychology or field of research to another, and the adaptation of methods from other disciplines which have relevance for psychological research practice. The journal considers research methods across the whole spectrum, and welcomes articles which take a quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods approach to research. The journal solicits original theoretical, empirical, and methodological articles that have psychological relevance discussing new innovative applications or adaptations of methodologies and methods, or articles offering reviews of important methodological issues and innovations. The journal aims to be the leading forum for psychology researchers from all areas of psychology, and seeks to offer original and ground-breaking articles on research methods that advance the field. The intended audience for journal content is academics, researchers, students and practitioners across diverse fields of psychology who seek relevant and informative content on the latest in research methods and research practices. The journal does not seek to publish technical research articles for specialist methodologists, or to publish research where research methods and practices are not the primary focus. Submissions should make explicit how the theories, methods and procedures they discuss enhance the quality and value of psychological research, and should be written to be accessible to a wide non-technical audience across psychology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101081717&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101081717\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This discipline is defined broadly as the study of how boys' and men's psychology is influenced and shaped by both gender and sex, and encompasses the study of the social construction of gender, sex differences and similarities, and biological processes. We are interested in work that arises from applied specialties (clinical, counseling, school, and I/O psychology), foundational areas (social, developmental, cognition, emotion, and biopsychology), and integrative fields (neuroscience, behavioral medicine, and behavioral neuroendocrinology). We welcome research using diverse methodologies, including both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Scholarship advancing our understanding of men's psychology across the life span; across racial, ethnic, sexual orientation and gender identity groups; across national boundaries; and across historical time is welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied
