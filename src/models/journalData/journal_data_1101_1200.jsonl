JAPA publishes double-blind peer reviewed, original research and analysis. It aspires to bring insight to planning the future, to air a variety of perspectives, to publish the highest quality work, and to engage readers. JAPA is interested in manuscripts that examine historical or contemporary planning experience, broadly defined, in domestic or global contexts, and that do at least one of the following: contribute to the theoretical and conceptual foundation of planning; improve the link between planning and successful policy implementation; advance the methods used in planning practice and planning research; explain empirical relationships important to planning; interpret noteworthy physical, economic, and social phenomena that have spatial dimensions; or analyze significant consequences of planning approaches, processes, and contexts. JAPA prefers vivid and direct writing in the active voice.

Moreover, the study of microbes continues to provide novel insights into such fundamental processes as the molecular basis of cellular and organismal function. PLOS Pathogens reflects the full breadth of research in these areas by publishing outstanding original articles that significantly advance the understanding of pathogens and how they interact with their host organisms. Topics include (but are not limited to) adaptive and innate immune defenses as well as pathogen countermeasures, emerging pathogens, evolution, genomics and gene regulation, model host organisms, pathogen-cell biology, pathogenesis, prions, proteomics and signal transduction, rational vaccine design, structural biology, and virulence factors. The journal will not consider purely descriptive studies, such as those that solely identify a new genomic sequence of a related pathogen or a series of related pathogens, the isolation of pathogen variants, or a new strain or type based only on sequence analysis or correlative studies of host and pathogen genotypes. Genomics studies, which include functional predictions or inferences based on genome sequence analysis, will also require additional experimental validation that directly tests the prediction/inference and yields novel conclusions about mechanistic models or pathogenesis. Instances where inferences about potential functions can be supported by association studies of genotype-phenotype combined with existing functional data, may also be appropriate, pending approval by the editors. If a paper provides novel mechanistic insight but lacks functional validation, it may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod's discovery in 1961 of monoamine reuptake by pre-synaptic neurons still forms the basis of contemporary antidepressant treatment. There is a grievous gap between the explosion of knowledge in neuroscience and conceptually novel treatments for our patients. Translational Psychiatry bridges this gap by fostering and highlighting the pathway from discovery to clinical applications, healthcare and global health. We view translation broadly as the full spectrum of work that marks the pathway from discovery to global health, inclusive. The steps of translation that are within the scope of Translational Psychiatry include (i) fundamental discovery, (ii) bench to bedside, (iii) bedside to clinical applications (clinical trials), (iv) translation to policy and health care guidelines, (v) assessment of health policy and usage, and (vi) global health. All areas of medical research, including — but not restricted to — molecular biology, genetics, pharmacology, imaging and epidemiology are welcome as they contribute to enhance the field of translational psychiatry.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900191866&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900191866\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It publishes original papers in all areas of social psychology including: • social cognition • attitudes • group processes • social influence • intergroup relations • self and identity • nonverbal communication • social psychological aspects of personality, affect and emotion • language and discourse Submissions addressing these topics from a variety of approaches and methods, both quantitative and qualitative are welcomed. We publish papers of the following kinds: • empirical papers that address theoretical issues; • theoretical papers, including analyses of existing social psychological theories and presentations of theoretical innovations, extensions, or integrations; • review papers that provide an evaluation of work within a given area of social psychology and that present proposals for further research in that area; • methodological papers concerning issues that are particularly relevant to a wide range of social psychologists; • an invited agenda article as the first article in the first part of every volume.

One of the fundamental goals of the journal is the use of evidence from rigorous investigation to identify and address the increasingly complex issues confronting teacher education at the national and global levels. These issues include but are not limited to preparing teachers to effectively address the needs of marginalized youth, their families and communities; program design and impact; selection, recruitment and retention of teachers from underrepresented groups; local and national policy; accountability; and routes to certification. JTE does not publish book reviews, program evaluations or articles solely describing programs, program components, courses or personal experiences. In addition, JTE does not accept manuscripts that are solely about the development or validation of an instrument unless the use of that instrument yields data providing new insights into issues of relevance to teacher education (MSU, February 2016).

We publish interdisciplinary work that draws from the social sciences, humanities and computational social sciences, reaches out to the arts and natural sciences, and we endorse mixed methods and methodologies. The journal is open to a diversity of theoretic paradigms and methodologies. The editorial vision of Social Media + Society draws inspiration from research on social media to outline a field of study poised to reflexively grow as social technologies evolve. We foster the open access of sharing of research on the social properties of media, as they manifest themselves through the uses people make of networked platforms past and present, digital and non. The journal presents a collaborative, open, and shared space, dedicated exclusively to the study of social media and their implications for societies.

By providing clear, insightful, balanced contributions by international experts, the journal intends to serve all those involved in the care of those affected by psychiatric disorders. We accomplish this aim by appointing international authorities to serve as Section Editors in key subject areas, such as anxiety, medicopsychiatric disorders, and schizophrenia and other related psychotic disorders. Section Editors, in turn, select topics for which leading experts contribute comprehensive review articles that emphasize new developments and recently published papers of major importance, highlighted by annotated reference lists. An international Editorial Board reviews the annual table of contents, suggests articles of special interest to their country/region, and ensures that topics are current and include emerging research. Commentaries from well-known figures in the field are also provided.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychiatry and Mental Health","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15011&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15011\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
