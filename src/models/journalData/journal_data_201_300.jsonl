In addition to publishing work spanning all areas of cell biology and developmental biology, we have particular interest in how these fields interface with each other and with other disciplines in biology. The journal aims to showcase work that examines, through a cell biological lens, the fundamentals of how a cell works, how cells interact with one another and with the environment, how cells come together to form a tissue, organ, and ultimately a whole organism, and what happens when any of these processes go awry. Developmental Cell will consider papers in any area of cell biology or developmental biology, as well as at the interface either of these fields make to any other areas in biology. Examples of these include signaling, cell proliferation, polarity, cell migration, cell lineage and fate specification, chromatin regulation and function, cancer cell biology, evo-devo, disease etiology, membrane traffic, metabolic regulation, morphogenesis and biomechanics, organ development, ncRNAs, stem cell biology, and regeneration. We are also interested in studies building on large datasets or developing new tools that could be good fits for our Resource or Technology formats. The primary criterion for publication in Developmental Cell, as for all Cell Press journals, is new biological insight. We are happy to consider any study that leads to important new conclusions about biological function.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cell Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18525&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18525\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Papers cover diverse issues including: psychopathology, psychotherapy, behavior therapy, cognition and cognitive therapies, behavioral medicine, community mental health, assessment, and child development. Papers should be cutting edge and advance the science and/or practice of clinical psychology. Reviews on other topics, such as psychophysiology, learning therapy, experimental psychopathology, and social psychology often appear if they have a clear relationship to research or practice in clinical psychology. Integrative literature reviews and summary reports of innovative ongoing clinical research programs are also sometimes published.

Research from different disciplines, such as organizational behavior and theory, strategic management, psychology, sociology, economics, political science, information systems, technology management, communication, and cognitive science, is represented in the journal. We welcome research at different levels of analysis, including the organization, the groups or units that constitute organizations, and the networks in which organizations are embedded. Diverse methods and approaches are also welcome. Creative insight often occurs at the boundaries between traditional research approaches and topic areas. The editors are especially interested in manuscripts that break new ground rather than ones that make incremental contributions. In addition to the original research reports that are the core of the journal, we occasionally publish essays in our “Perspectives” section that direct attention to an important new organizational phenomenon or redirect a line of research. We also publish essays in our “Crossroads” section that capture a current debate about organizations. More specifically, Organization Science seeks to publish papers that start or redirect a line of inquiry; draw upon multiple disciplines; employ diverse methods, including qualitative, field, survey, archival, laboratory, and computational methods; focus on different kinds of organizations, including firms, not-for-profit organizations, and voluntary organizations; make a theoretical contribution; provide new empirical findings; achieve genuine integration of theory and data; provide a theoretically driven review and integration of an important research area; and/or discuss findings in terms of improving organizational performance.

The purpose of the journal is to publish high-impact manuscripts that report relevant research on important problems in operations management (OM). The field of OM is the study of the innovative or traditional processes for the design, procurement, production, delivery, and recovery of goods and services. OM research entails the control, planning, design, and improvement of these processes. This research can be prescriptive, descriptive, or predictive; however, the intent of the research is ultimately to develop some form of enduring knowledge that can lead to more efficient or effective processes for the creation and delivery of goods and services. M&SOM encourages a variety of methodological approaches to OM research; papers may be theoretical or empirical, analytical or computational, and may be based on a range of established research disciplines. M&SOM encourages contributions in OM across the full spectrum of decision making: strategic, tactical, and operational. Furthermore, the journal supports research that examines pertinent issues at the interfaces between OM and other functional areas.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Management Science and Operations Research","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Strategy and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21789&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21789\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal includes within its scope all aspects of management related to strategy, entrepreneurship, innovation, technology, and organizations as well as all functional areas of business, such as accounting, finance, information systems, marketing, and operations. The journal includes studies on organizational, managerial, group and individual decision making, from both normative and descriptive perspectives. The articles are primarily based on the foundational disciplines of computer science, economics, mathematics, psychology, sociology, and statistics, but cross-functional, multidisciplinary research that reflects the diversity of the management science professions is also encouraged. The journal interest extends to managerial issues in diverse organizational forms, such as for-profit and nonprofit firms, private and public sector institutions, and formal and informal networks of individuals. We welcome theoretical, experimental (field or lab) and empirical contributions.

It encourages the interplay between theorizing and empirical research, in the belief that they should be mutually informative. It is a multidisciplinary peer-reviewed journal which is open to contributions of high quality, from any perspective relevant to the field and from any country. Organization Studies is, in particular, a supranational journal which gives special attention to national and cultural similarities and differences worldwide. This is reflected by its international editorial board and publisher and its collaboration with EGOS, the European Group for Organizational Studies. OS publishes papers that fully or partly draw on empirical data to make their contribution to organization theory and practice. Thus, OS welcomes work that in any form draws on empirical work to make strong theoretical and empirical contributions. If your paper is not drawing on empirical data in any form, we advise you to submit your work to Organization Theory – another journal under the auspices of the European Group for Organizational Studies (EGOS) – instead.

Molecular Systems Biology is a peer-reviewed open access journal that publishes high-quality research in the fields of systems biology, synthetic biology and systems medicine. The Editors select manuscripts based on their novelty and wide biological significance. Although the primary emphasis of the journal is on molecular components and their interactions, systems studies at the organ level may also be considered. Works describing large-scale datasets will be judged, in part, by the extent to which these datasets are integrated both with each other and with computational models, with the ultimate aim to better understand the dynamic and complex nature of living systems. Reports of new experimental methods will also be considered in the context of this policy. Topics falling within the scope of the journal include, but are not limited to: - integrative genome-scale biology - quantitative biology - computational biology - metabolic and regulatory networks - evolution of genomes and biological networks - clinical and translational systems biology - synthetic biology and genome-scale biological engineering - Molecular Systems Biology publishes research articles as full-length Articles or short Reports. The journal also publishes Methods, Reviews, News & Views, Correspondences and Editorials.

Papers that are solely or predominantly based in cell and molecular biology are published in the companion journal, the American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology. The Journal also seeks to publish clinical trials and outstanding review articles on areas of interest in several forms. The State-of-the-Art review is a treatise usually covering a broad field that brings bench research to the bedside. Shorter reviews are published as Critical Care Perspectives or Pulmonary Perspectives. These are generally focused on a more limited area and advance a concerted opinion about care for a specific process. Concise Clinical Reviews provide an evidence-based synthesis of the literature pertaining to topics of fundamental importance to the practice of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine. Images providing advances or unusual contributions to the field are published as Images in Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep Medicine and the Sciences.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=18000&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=18000\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

In a new and urgent era of sustainable development, The Lancet Planetary Health seeks to be the pre-eminent journal for inquiry into sustainable human civilisations at a time when those civilisations face unprecedented dangers and threats. The scope of the journal is therefore wide and interdisciplinary, and includes poverty, nutrition, gender equity, water and sanitation, energy, economic growth, industrialisation, inequality, urbanisation, human consumption and production, climate change, ocean health, land use, peace, and justice. Put simply, The Lancet Planetary Health aims to be the leading journal of, and for, sustainable development.

Evolution is the unifying concept than runs through all the life sciences, from the origin and diversification of life to understanding human behaviour to dealing with the challenges posed by disease. Ecology takes biology from the relative simplicity of individuals to explain the complexity of interactions between organisms and their environments. Its implications stretch beyond biology into environmental science and the grand challenges facing society. Nature Ecology & Evolution is interested in the full spectrum of ecological and evolutionary biology, encompassing approaches at the molecular, organismal, population, community and ecosystem levels, as well as relevant parts of the social sciences. Nature Ecology & Evolution provides a place where all researchers and policymakers interested in all aspects of life's diversity can come together to learn about the most accomplished and significant advances in the field and to discuss topical issues. An online-only monthly journal, our broad scope ensures that the research published reaches the widest possible audience of scientists.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100831440&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100831440\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Recognizing that materials discovery and development facilitate groundbreaking technologies bridging multiple disciplines, Matter will embrace all significant advances in materials research, encompassing the previously unknown and the innovative. A key focus will be on transformative research, related to fundamental structure, synthesis and assembly, properties and performance of emerging material systems, as well as novel characterization methods, thereby encapsulating key aspects of materials science. Materials of focus can be any state, any scale, any composition – i.e., any Matter - with scientific or technological interest, theoretical or otherwise. Matter will highlight material type and scale of interest for each study, while also explicitly assessing the stage of material development, click here for more details. In this way, while still stressing fundamental science, materials advancement and progression can be tracked and put into context of potential impact, from concept to societal usage. Matter provides full-length research articles, reviews, topical perspectives, paper previews, opinions, personnel stories, and other editorial content of general interest to the global materials community. The journal aims to be the premier resource for researchers in both academia and industry, providing a platform of inspiration for the next generation of materials scientists.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100943502&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100943502\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Disciplines in the physical sciences have met this challenge for a long time, and we've found that our strongest papers tend to apply classic approaches taken in physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science to salient biological questions. Manuscripts describing discoveries, milestone achievements, broadly useful tools or resources, or insights into the use of technology may all be appropriate. Cross-disciplinary studies that reveal general principles of systems are particularly welcome. We believe it's our responsibility to ensure that the next generation of scientists can begin their work on solid ground. Accordingly, we focus our review process on validity and scientific acuity, rather than more subjective feelings and opinions. We also believe that scientific transparency is of paramount importance. A study's structure and presentation should be candid and forthright (e.g. it should ensure fair comparisons; it should either use non-arbitrary cut-offs or clearly explained arbitrary cut-offs that do not affect outcomes; its data visualization choices should promote objective understanding; its limitations should not be obscured). Fundamentally good scientific practice also demands that studies be repeatable. We encourage authors to make their code and data FAIR—that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, as defined by the NIH Data Commons. Although it is too early to formally require that all studies we publish be FAIR, we consider that requirement annually.
