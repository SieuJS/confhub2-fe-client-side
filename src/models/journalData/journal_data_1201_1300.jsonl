It aims to publish articles of high quality dealing with the application of existing as well as new econometric techniques to a wide variety of problems in economics and related subjects, covering topics in measurement, estimation, testing, forecasting, and policy analysis. The emphasis is on the careful and rigorous application of econometric techniques and the appropriate interpretation of the results. The economic content of the articles is stressed. A special feature of the Journal is its emphasis on the replicability of results by other researchers. To achieve this aim, authors are expected to make available a complete set of the data used as well as any specialised computer programs employed through a readily accessible medium, preferably in a machine-readable form. The use of microcomputers in applied research and transferability of data is emphasised. The Journal also features occasional sections of short papers re-evaluating previously published papers. The intention of the Journal of Applied Econometrics is to provide an outlet for innovative, quantitative research in economics which cuts across areas of specialisation, involves transferable techniques, and is easily replicable by other researchers. Contributions that introduce statistical methods that are applicable to a variety of economic problems are actively encouraged. The Journal also aims to publish review and survey articles that make recent developments in the field of theoretical and applied econometrics more readily accessible to applied economists in general.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=28964&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=28964\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Theoretical papers of scholarly substance on abnormality may be appropriate if they advance understanding of a specific issue directly relevant to abnormal psychology and fall within the length restrictions of a regular (not extended) article. Case Studies from either a clinical setting or a laboratory will be considered if they raise or illustrate important questions that go beyond the single case and have heuristic value.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological Psychiatry","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biological

Papers from other disciplines (e.g., law) will be considered only if they provide a key policy contribution, and are written in a style which is accessible to a social science readership.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics

JLS provides a multidisciplinary forum for research on education and learning that informs theories of how people learn and the design of learning environments. It publishes research that elucidates processes of learning, and the ways in which technologies, instructional practices, and learning environments can be designed to support learning in different contexts. JLS articles draw on theoretical frameworks from such diverse fields as cognitive science, sociocultural theory, educational psychology, computer science, and anthropology. Submissions are not limited to any particular research method, but must be based on rigorous analyses that present new insights into how people learn and/or how learning can be supported and enhanced. Successful submissions should position their argument within extant literature in the learning sciences.

JPS pays special attention to questions of ‘agency’ of marginalized groups in agrarian societies, particularly their autonomy and capacity to interpret – and change – their conditions. The Journal encourages contributions from across the social sciences which: question mainstream prescriptions; interrogate orthodoxies in radical thinking; explore theoretical, policy and political

Issues concerning finfish and aquatic invertebrates prized for their economic or recreational importance, their value as indicators of environmental health, or their natural beauty are addressed. An important resource that keeps you apprised of the latest changes in the field, each issue of Reviews in Fisheries Science & Aquaculture presents useful information to fisheries and aquaculture scientists in academia, state and federal natural resources agencies, and the private sector. The sheer amount of literature produced in fisheries and aquaculture often makes it difficult to identify new concepts and judge the significance of new information. Abstracting services and conventional review articles can be valuable, but they don’t assess the importance of the information or judge its reliability. One of the principal objectives of Reviews in Fisheries Science & Aquaculture is to make these assessments and judgments. The journal publishes only those critical reviews that present the latest, most significant developments in the field.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aquatic

We publish papers that cover any aspect of people management that are relevant to the field. IJHRM welcomes papers that are based in any discipline – for example organizational behavior, occupational psychology or labour economics – as long as there is a clear link to the HRM literature and that they develop strong implications for HR practice. Papers are expected to make a contribution to theory and practice in human resource management. We welcome rigorous research from across the spectrum of methods such as qualitative, quantitative as well as review and conceptual approaches. The Journal has a long track record of interest in papers covering international and comparative HR issues but also publishes work that is set in one country only. We are proud to be globally inclusive and to publish work from areas of the world that are often neglected in the mainstream HR research. We encourage authors to contextualize their studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Business and International Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Business and International

The remit of Public Management Review is to promote the dissemination and discussion of such research about public management. Its specific target audience is the academic and research community. Public Management Review is an international journal, seeking to draw together and learn lessons from the development of public management across the world rather than being parochially focused upon one area and encourages cross-national and comparative research papers. The journal promotes inter-disciplinary work. Much of the most important work about public management is coming at the cusp of traditional disciplines. Public Management Review promotes such cross-boundary learning and conceptualisation.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=4700152305&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=4700152305\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal aims to understand how gene and chromosomal elements are regulated and their activities maintained during processes such as cell division, differentiation and environmental alteration. Epigenetic research is concerned with heritable changes that do not change DNA sequence, but rather involve stable modifications of chromatin, DNA or protein conformation, and includes research on non-coding RNAs, nuclear organization and chromatin interactions. Epigenetics is a broad area of research that is important for understanding the basic processes of cellular life, and as such has implications for a wide range of disciplines. The field encompasses studies that use model systems to discover and investigate epigenetic mechanisms and studies of human development with an emphasis on epigenetic mechanisms or chromatin organization. Epigenetics & Chromatin fulfills the need for a journal that reflects the breadth of epigenetic research. Topics include, but are not limited to, gene silencing and imprinting, nuclear reprogramming, nucleosome modification, remodeling and dynamics, DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, chromosomal maintenance elements, dosage compensation and nuclear organization. Approaches that apply cutting-edge technologies to problems in the field are especially welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Molecular Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700174932&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700174932\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Biosensors & Bioelectronics is the principal international journal devoted to research, design, development and application of biosensors and bioelectronics. It is an interdisciplinary journal serving professionals with an interest in the exploitation of biological materials and designs in novel diagnostic and electronic devices including sensors, DNA chips, electronic noses, lab-on-a-chip and μ-TAS. Biosensors usually yield a digital electronic signal which is proportional to the concentration of a specific analyte or group of analytes. While the signal may in principle be continuous, devices can be configured to yield single measurements to meet specific market requirements. Examples of Biosensors include immunosensors, enzyme-based biosensors, organism- and whole cell-based biosensors. They have been applied to a wide variety of analytical problems including uses in medicine, biomedical research, drug discovery, the environment, food, process industries, security and defence. The design and study of molecular and supramolecular structures with molecular biorecognition and biomimetic properties for use in analytical devices is also included within the scope of the journal. Here the focus is on the complementary intersection between molecular recognition, nanotechnology, molecular imprinting and supramolecular chemistry to improve the analytical performance and robustness of devices.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biomedical Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biomedical

Preference will be given to those articles which address clinically relevant questions or which provide new insights into human biology. Unless reporting entirely novel and unusual aspects of a topic, clinical case reports, cytogenetic case reports, papers on descriptive population genetics, articles dealing with the frequency of polymorphisms or additional mutations within genes in which numerous lesions have already been described, and papers that report meta-analyses of previously published datasets will normally not be accepted. The Journal typically will not consider for publication manuscripts that report merely the isolation, map position, structure, and tissue expression profile of a gene of unknown function unless the gene is of particular interest or is a candidate gene involved in a human trait or disorder.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=22245&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=22245\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}
