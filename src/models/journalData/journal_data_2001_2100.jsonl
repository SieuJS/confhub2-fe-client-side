By enhancing communication between workers in the field throughout the world, the JIMD aims to improve the management and understanding of inherited metabolic disorders. It publishes results of original research and new or important observations pertaining to any aspect of inherited metabolic disease in humans and higher animals. This includes clinical (medical, dental and veterinary), biochemical, genetic (including cytogenetic, molecular and population genetic), experimental (including cell biological), methodological, theoretical, epidemiological, ethical and counselling aspects. The JIMD also reviews important new developments or controversial issues relating to metabolic disorders and publishes reviews and short reports arising from the Society's annual symposia. A distinction is made between peer-reviewed scientific material that is selected because of its significance for other professionals in the field and non-peer- reviewed material that aims to be important, controversial, interesting or entertaining (“Extras”).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Genetics (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15106&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15106\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

With a focus on process-oriented and comparative studies, it covers, but is not restricted to, subjects such as: (1) Chemical, biological, biochemical and cosmochemical evolution; the origin of life; the evolution of the oceans and atmosphere; the early fossil record; palaeobiology; (2) Geochronology and isotope and elemental geochemistry; (3) Precambrian mineral deposits; (4) Geophysical aspects of the early Earth and Precambrian terrains; (5) Nature, formation and evolution of the Precambrian lithosphere and mantle including magmatic, depositional, metamorphic and tectonic processes. In addition, the editors particularly welcome integrated process-oriented studies that involve a combination of the above fields and comparative studies that demonstrate the effect of Precambrian evolution on Phanerozoic earth system processes. Regional and localised studies of Precambrian phenomena are considered appropriate only when the detail and quality allow illustration of a wider process, or when significant gaps in basic knowledge of a particular area can be filled.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geochemistry and Petrology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=25755&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=25755\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Understanding of the Earth system as it was in the past requires the employment of a wide range of approaches including marine and lacustrine sedimentology and speleothems; ice sheet formation and flow; stable isotope, trace element, and organic geochemistry; paleontology and molecular paleontology; evolutionary processes; mineralization in organisms; understanding tree-ring formation; seismic stratigraphy; physical, chemical, and biological oceanography; geochemical, climate and earth system modeling, and many others. The scope of this journal is regional to global, rather than local, and includes studies of any geologic age (Precambrian to Quaternary, including modern analogs). Within this framework, papers on the following topics are to be included: chronology, stratigraphy (where relevant to correlation of paleoceanographic events), paleoreconstructions, paleoceanographic modeling, paleocirculation (deep, intermediate, and shallow), paleoclimatology (e.g., paleowinds and cryosphere history), global sediment and geochemical cycles, anoxia, sea level changes and effects, relations between biotic evolution and paleoceanography, biotic crises, paleobiology (e.g., ecology of “microfossils” used in paleoceanography), techniques and approaches in paleoceanographic inferences, and modern paleoceanographic analogs, and quantitative and integrative analysis of coupled ocean-atmosphere-biosphere processes. Paleoceanographic and Paleoclimate studies enable us to use the past in order to gain information on possible future climatic and biotic developments: the past is the key to the future, just as much and maybe more than the present is the key to the past.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atmospheric Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Oceanography","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Paleontology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100852202&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100852202\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

With an emphasis on rapid review and dissemination, AERA Open aims to advance knowledge through theoretical and empirical study across arenas of inquiry related to education and learning. AERA Open emphasizes publishing scientific and scholarly work that adds to knowledge incrementally and cumulatively. AERA Open also serves as a venue for innovation, novel inquiry and ideas, interdisciplinary bridge building, and research that fosters the connection of research to practice and practice to research. AERA Open’s content will transcend the boundaries between education research and other adjacent fields of inquiry, formal and informal education, research and development, education and other social institutions in society, early and later stages of human development, and scientific and humanistic study. By design, AERA Open seeks to avert the silos and stereotypes that can lead to favoring one rigorous method over another or one conceptual framework or model as more robust than another. AERA Open will not only make knowledge available, it will also use its available space to promote access to data; research instruments, protocols and guides; and other supplemental sources of information that will enhance the value of articles as well as stimulate others to pursue research or its application. As an online journal, AERA Open will provide a publishing venue for works in new and innovative formats, such as video, interactive data tables, and audio recordings that a print format precludes.

The AMS has a single blind peer-review process in which the reviewers know who the authors of the manuscript are, but the authors do not have access to the information on who the peer reviewers are. This journal is devoted to research articles in all areas of pure and applied mathematics. To be published in the Transactions, a paper must be correct, new, and significant. Further, it must be well written and of interest to a substantial number of mathematicians.

In all cases, manuscripts must address implications and provide insight regarding agricultural water management. The primary topics that we consider are the following: • Farm-level and regional water management • Crop water relations, crop yields and water productivity • Irrigation, drainage, and salinity in cultivated areas • Salinity management and strategies for improving the use of saline water in agriculture • Rainwater harvesting and crop water management in rainfed areas • Use of wastewater and other low quality waters in agriculture • Groundwater management in agriculture and conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water • Implications of groundwater and surface water management on nutrient cycling • Exploitation and protection of agricultural water resources. Additional topics of interest include interactions between agricultural water management and the environment (flooding, soil erosion, nutrient loss and depletion, non-point source pollution, water quality, desertification, and the potential implications of global climate change for agricultural water management), and the institutional and regulatory aspects of agricultural water management (water pricing, allocation and competition). Papers in these categories must draw direct and practical linkages to agricultural water management. Manuscripts drawing generalised conclusions, such as that competition for water will increase in future, or that less water will be available for agriculture, are unlikely to be considered. Also, manuscripts describing basic soil-water-plant relationships, basic engineering and hydrology, or methods of estimating evapotranspiration will be considered only if the discussion is relevant to the active management of water in agriculture and the information enhances international literature.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop

It publishes papers which illustrate the direct application of control theory and its supporting tools in all possible areas of automation. As a result, the journal only contains papers which can be considered to have made significant contributions to the application of advanced control techniques. It is normally expected that practical results should be included, but where simulation only studies are available, it is necessary to demonstrate that the simulation model is representative of a genuine application. Strictly theoretical papers will find a more appropriate home in Control Engineering Practice's sister publication, Automatica. It is also expected that papers are innovative with respect to the state of the art and are sufficiently detailed for a reader to be able to duplicate the main results of the paper (supplementary material, including datasets, tables, code and any relevant interactive material can be made available and downloaded from the website). The benefits of the presented methods must be made very clear and the new techniques must be compared and contrasted with results obtained using existing methods. Moreover, a thorough analysis of failures that may happen in the design process and implementation can also be part of the paper. The scope of Control Engineering Practice matches the activities of IFAC. Papers demonstrating the contribution of automation and control in improving the performance, quality, productivity, sustainability, resource and energy efficiency, and the manageability of systems and processes for the benefit of mankind and are relevant to industrial practitioners are most welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied

These include, among others, transportation, economics, investment strategy, inventory control, logistics, safety, reliability, urban planning, and ecology. Computers & Operations Research (COR) provides an international forum for the application of computers and operations research techniques to problems in these and related fields. The common element in all the scientific areas that this Journal addresses is the need for some optimization methodology for determining viable solutions to problems, using computers and the techniques of operations research. However, it is not only the methodology which is of interest: the applications are of equal importance. The two are mutually supportive, since understanding the application helps one greatly to comprehend the optimization methods used, and vice versa.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Computer Science

The key criterion is that such articles must present significant new insights into biological, chemical or medical sciences. The inclusion of complementary data that support the conclusions drawn from the structural studies (such as binding studies, mass spectrometry, enzyme assays, or analysis of mutants or other modified forms of biological macromolecule) is encouraged. Methods articles may include new approaches to any aspect of biological structure determination or structure analysis but will only be accepted where they focus on new methods that are demonstrated to be of general applicability and importance to structural biology.

We strive to publish high-quality scientific articles, where quality includes, but is not limited to, the quality and clarity of text, and the validity of methods and approaches. Food Security is the initiative of a distinguished international group of scientists from different disciplines who hold a deep concern for the challenge of global food security, together with a vision of the power of shared knowledge as a means of meeting that challenge. To address the challenge of global food security, the journal seeks to address the constraints - physical, biological and socio-economic - which not only limit food production but also the ability of people to access a healthy diet. From this perspective, the journal covers the following areas: Global food needs: the mismatch between population and the ability to provide adequate nutrition Global food potential and global food production Natural constraints to satisfying global food needs: § Climate, climate variability, and climate change § Desertification and flooding § Natural disasters § Soils, soil quality and threats to soils, edaphic and other abiotic constraints to production § Biotic constraints to production, pathogens, pests, and weeds in their effects on sustainable production The sociological contexts of food production, access, quality, and consumption. Nutrition, food quality and food safety. Socio-political factors that impinge on the ability to satisfy global food needs: § Land, agricultural and food policy § International relations and trade § Access to food § Financial policy § Wars and ethnic unrest Research policies and priorities to ensure food security in its various dimensions.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agronomy and Crop Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Food Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19500157549&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19500157549\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

While the journal does not consider authoritarianism simply as a pre-stage to democracy, it also welcomes studies on various aspects of authoritarian polities, politics and policies, with the journal’s explicit aim to develop a broader understanding of possible relationships between authoritarian and democratic politics. While the focus lies on democratization viewed as a process, the journal also builds on the enduring interest in democracy itself and its analysis. Democratization looks at contemporary developments through a comparative lens. There is special reference to democracy, autocracy and democratization in the regions of the Global South and in post-communist societies, but not to the exclusion of other relevant areas such as North America, Australasia, and the European Union and its member states.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Political Science and International Relations","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=24034&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp;

The journal includes studies based on modern economic, political economic, and international relations theories, using quantitative or qualitative methods. Papers should ideally put forward a new theory and provide a rigorous empirical test of this theory, but the RIO allows for a trade-off between the two. The RIO features a comment section where it invites comments to articles published in the Review of International Organizations and elsewhere. Replication is particularly encouraged. The RIO invites submission of data articles. Compared to regular articles, data articles focus less on theory and should present high-quality, important and relevant data that can be expected to be widely used by the research community.

Papers considered for publication must be significant at both the mathematical level and the level of applications or potential applications. Papers containing mostly routine mathematics or those with no discernible connection to control and systems theory or optimization will not be considered for publication. From time to time, the journal will also publish authoritative surveys of important subject areas in control theory and optimization whose level of maturity permits a clear and unified exposition. The broad areas mentioned above are intended to encompass a wide range of mathematical techniques and scientific, engineering, economic, and industrial applications. These include stochastic and deterministic methods in control, estimation, and identification of systems; modeling and realization of complex control systems; the numerical analysis and related computational methodology of control processes and allied issues; and the development of mathematical theories and techniques that give new insights into old problems or provide the basis for further progress in control theory and optimization. Within the field of optimization, the journal focuses on the parts that are relevant to dynamic and control systems. Contributions to numerical methodology are also welcome in accordance with these aims, especially as related to large-scale problems and decomposition as well as to fundamental questions of convergence and approximation.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Control and Optimization","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=26405&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=26405\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal accepts submissions of full-length papers and short communications on substance-related addictions such as the abuse of alcohol, drugs and nicotine, and behavioral addictions involving gambling and technology. We primarily publish behavioral and psychosocial research but our articles span the fields of psychology, sociology, psychiatry, epidemiology, social policy, medicine, pharmacology and neuroscience. While theoretical orientations are diverse, the emphasis of the journal is primarily empirical. That is, sound experimental design combined with valid, reliable assessment and evaluation procedures are a requisite for acceptance. However, innovative and empirically oriented case studies that might encourage new lines of inquiry are accepted as well. Studies that clearly contribute to current knowledge of etiology, prevention, social policy or treatment are given priority. Scholarly commentaries on topical issues, systematic reviews, and mini reviews are encouraged. We especially welcome multimedia papers that incorporate video or audio components to better display methodology or findings. Studies can also be submitted to Addictive Behaviors? companion title, the open access journal Addictive Behaviors Reports, which has a particular interest in 'non-traditional', innovative and empirically-oriented research such as negative/null data papers, replication studies, case reports on novel treatments, and cross-cultural research.

By its very nature, this field highlights the interrelationships among the traditionally self-contained disciplines of Cognitive Biology; Science; Economics; Linguistics; Neuroscience; Philosophy; and Psychology; each of these is thus represented as a major topic covered by WIREs Cognitive Science. This journal will review research from all these fields with the potential to illuminate how the mind is structured, how it has evolved, how it develops through life, and how its functions are instantiated in neural circuits and computations.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Neuroscience (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Psychology (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19900191715&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19900191715\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

By 2018, ET&S has achieved its purposes at the first stage by providing an international forum for open access scientific dialogue for developers, educators and researchers to foster the development of research in educational technology. Thanks to all of the Authors, Reviewers and Readers, the journal has enjoyed tremendous success. Starting from 2019, the ET&S journal has established a solid and stable editorial office with the support of National Yunlin University of Science and Technology. The new Editors-in-Chief have been appointed aiming to promote innovative educational technology research based on empirical inquires to echo the pedagogical essentials of learning in the real world—lifelong learning, competency-orientation, and multimodal literacy in the 21st century. ET&S publishes the research that well bridges the pedagogy and practice in advanced technology for evidence-based and meaningfully educational application. The focus of ET&S is not only technology per se, but rather issues related to the process continuum of learning, teaching, and assessment and how they are affected or enhanced using technologies rooted in a long-period base. The empirical research about how technology can be used to overcome the existing problems in the frontline of local education with findings that can be applied to the global spectrum is also welcome. However, papers with only descriptions of the results obtained from one hit-and-run and short-term study or those with the results obtained from self-report surveys without systematic or empirical data or any analysis on learning outcomes or processes are not favorable to be included in ET&S.

The Journal is already the leading international outlet devoted to reporting interdisciplinary research on behavioural development, and has now, in response to the rapidly developing fields of behavioural genetics, neuroscience and developmental psychopathology, expanded its scope to these and other related new domains of scholarship. In this way, it provides a truly world-wide platform for researchers which can facilitate a greater integrated lifespan perspective. In addition to original empirical research, the Journal also publishes theoretical and review papers, methodological papers, and other work of scientific interest that represents a significant advance in the understanding of any aspect of behavioural development. The Journal also publishes papers on behaviour development research within or across particular geographical regions. Papers are therefore considered from a wide range of disciplines, covering all aspects of the lifespan. Articles on topics of eminent current interest, such as research on the later life phases, biological processes in behaviour development, cross-national, and cross-cultural issues, and interdisciplinary research in general, are particularly welcome.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental and Educational Psychology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental

The litmus test for publishing in JIBP is policy relevance. We define international business policy to be the mix of actions that public authorities take to shape cross-border business transactions with the goal of addressing societal challenges. We welcome manuscripts that clearly showcase how their study matters for public policy debates, which can take place at the sub-national, national or supra-national level. Scholars can do this by exploring: The good, bad, and ugly influence of international business on public policy concerns, ranging from economic issues (e.g., development, innovation) to sustainability matters (e.g., societal inequality, environmental crises) to national security concerns (e.g., economic resilience, nationalism); The impact of public policies on cross-border business transactions; The influence of multinational firms, global value chains, and other forms of international business on the formulation of public policy; The public policies that governments should adopt to address societal challenges through the shaping of international business.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101066138&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101066138\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Articles published in the regular March, June and September issues of the journal, as well as articles accepted for publication in special issues of the journal, are subject to professional peer review and include economic, theoretical, and empirical analyses of tax and expenditure issues with an emphasis on policy implications. The NTJ has been published quarterly since 1948 under the auspices of the National Tax Association (NTA). Most issues include an NTJ Forum, which consists of invited papers by leading scholars that examine in depth a single current tax or expenditure policy issue. The December issue is devoted to publishing papers presented at the NTA’s annual Spring Symposium; the articles in the December issue generally are not subject to peer review.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Accounting","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Economics
