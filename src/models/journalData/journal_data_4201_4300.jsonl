These characteristics include genomic information as well as molecular, cellular, and image profiling and beyond, based on which individuals can be classified into subpopulations for specialized decision in the treatment and management of a disease. Precision medicine is one of the most exciting and promising frontiers in medicine, which holds the greatest potential in the discovery, development and application of precision prevention, diagnostics, therapeutics and prognostics. Such prospects necessitate concerted efforts from multi-disciplinary research and clinical experience in almost all fields of medicine to improve patient outcomes. Platforms are also required for the interaction of all involved knowledge to help healthcare professionals and researchers in the world exchange ideas, technologies, discoveries and experiences in applying precision medicine. Precision Clinical Medicine (PCM) commits itself to the combination of precision medical research and clinical application. PCM is an international, peer-reviewed, open access journal that publishes original research articles, case reports, reviews, editorials and perspectives on all aspects in the field of precision medicine in a timely manner. By doing so, the journal aims to provide new theories, methods, and evidence for disease diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prognosis, so as to establish a communication platform for clinicians and researchers that will impact practice of medicine. The journal covers all aspects of precision medicine, which uses novel means of diagnosis, treatment and prevention tailored to the needs of a patient or a sub-group of patients based on the specific genetic, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics. Clinical conditions include cancer, infectious disease, inherited diseases, complex diseases, rare diseases, etc.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101039769&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101039769\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The scope of the journal includes the significance of human activities in altering Earth's landscapes, oceans, the atmosphere, cryosphere, and ecosystems over a range of time and space scales - from global phenomena over geologic eras to single isolated events - including the linkages, couplings, and feedbacks among physical, chemical, and biological components of Earth systems. The journal also addresses how such alterations can have profound effects on, and implications for, human society. As the scale and pace of human interactions with Earth systems have intensified in recent decades, understanding human-induced alterations in the past and present is critical to our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and adapt to changes in the future. The journal aims to provide a venue to focus research findings, discussions, and debates toward advancing predictive understanding of human interactions with Earth systems - one of the grand challenges of our time.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Ecology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Global and Planetary Change","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100255737&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100255737\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Manuscripts should address not only the extent or epidemiology of the problem, but also describe interventions to effectively control and prevent CVDs and the underlying factors. The emphasis should be on approaches applicable in settings with limited resources. Economic evaluations of successful interventions are particularly welcome. We will also consider negative findings if important. While reports of hospital or clinic-based treatments are not excluded, particularly if they have broad implications for cost-effective disease control or prevention, we give priority to papers addressing community-based activities. We encourage submissions on cardiovascular surveillance and health policies, professional education, ethical issues and technological innovations related to prevention. Global Heart is particularly interested in publishing data from updated national or regional demographic health surveys, World Health Organization or Global Burden of Disease data, large clinical disease databases or registries. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses on globally relevant topics are welcome. We will also consider clinical research that has special relevance to LMICs, e.g. using validated instruments to assess health-related quality-of-life in patients from LMICs, innovative diagnostic-therapeutic applications, real-world effectiveness clinical trials, research methods (innovative methodologic papers, with emphasis on low-cost research methods or novel application of methods in low resource settings), and papers pertaining to cardiovascular health promotion and policy (quantitative evaluation of health programs.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Community and Home Care","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Epidemiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100212900&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100212900\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This success opens up a new frontier for interdisciplinary communications techniques using chemistry, biology, and other principles that have not been considered in the communications literature. The IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological, and Multi-Scale Communications is devoted to the principles, design, and analysis of communication systems that use physics beyond classical electromagnetism. This includes molecular, quantum, and other physical, chemical and biological techniques; as well as new communication techniques at small scales or across multiple scales (e.g., nano to micro to macro; note that strictly nanoscale systems, 1-100 nm, are outside the scope of this journal). Original research articles on one or more of the following topics are within scope: mathematical modeling, information/communication and network theoretic analysis, standardization and industrial applications, and analytical or experimental studies on communication processes or networks in biology. Contributions on related topics may also be considered for publication. Contributions from researchers outside the IEEE’s typical audience are encouraged.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biotechnology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Computer Networks and Communications","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Electrical and Electronic Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Modeling and Simulation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100976153&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100976153\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Rapidly changing socio-economic circumstances have important implications for young people: new opportunities have been created but inequality and marginalisation have increased and taken new forms. Launched in 1998, the Journal of Youth Studies has established itself as the leading multidisciplinary journal for academics who are interested in youth and young adulthood. As the leading journal in the field, the Journal of Youth Studies brings together social scientists from all regions of the world and working in a range of disciplines. These include sociology, education, social policy, cultural studies, political science, economics, anthropology, criminology and social geography. Ours is not a journal of adolescent psychology but we do accept papers that take a critical psychological perspective.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Life-span and Life-course

The Journal will present measures and data resources, analysis of the data, exploration of theoretical issues, and information about the status of children, as well as the implementation of this information in policy and practice. It explores how child indicators can be used to improve the development and well-being of children. Child Indicators Research will provide a unique, applied perspective, by presenting a variety of analytical models, different perspectives, and a range of social policy regimes. The Journal will break through the current ‘isolation’ of academicians, researchers and practitioners and serve as a ‘natural habitat’ for anyone interested in child indicators. Unique and exclusive, the Journal will be a source of high quality, policy impact and rigorous scientific papers. Readership: academicians, researchers, government officials, data collectors, providers of funding, practitioners, and journalists who have an interest in children’s well-being issues.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19400158810&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19400158810\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The areas of interest for Nutrition & Metabolism encompass studies in molecular nutrition in the context of obesity, diabetes, lipedemias, metabolic syndrome and exercise physiology. Manuscripts related to molecular, cellular and human metabolism, nutrient sensing and nutrient–gene interactions are also in interest, as are submissions that have employed new and innovative strategies like metabolomics/lipidomics or other omic-based biomarkers to predict nutritional status and metabolic diseases. Key areas we wish to encourage submissions from include: -how diet and specific nutrients interact with genes, proteins or metabolites to influence metabolic phenotypes and disease outcomes; -the role of epigenetic factors and the microbiome in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases and their influence on metabolic responses to diet and food components; -how diet and other environmental factors affect epigenetics and microbiota; the extent to which genetic and nongenetic factors modify personal metabolic responses to diet and food compositions and the mechanisms involved;

The journal presents research on various forms of translation and interpreting approached from historical, cultural, literary, sociological, linguistic, cognitive, philosophical, or other viewpoints that may be of relevance to the development of the discipline. It aims to combine the highest scholarly standards with maximum transparency and reader-friendliness. Target welcomes articles with a theoretical, empirical, or applied focus. It has a special preference for papers that somehow combine these dimensions and for those that position themselves at the cutting edge of the discipline. The purpose of the review section is to introduce and critically discuss the most important recent publications in the field and to reflect its evolution. The journal periodically zooms in on specific topics or areas by means of guest-edited special issues. It also welcomes shorter position papers to encourage open discussion in a “Forum” section of the journal. To facilitate involvement of authors, referees and readers from the whole world, the official language of publication of Target is English. To minimize the adverse effects of such a policy and honour the journal’s core topics of multilingualism and translation, Target runs an active and collaborative multilingual companion website, which welcomes translations into a wide range of languages of recent or older articles and reviews from the journal. Target publishes its articles Online First.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Communication","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Communication","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Linguistics and Language","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5800207676&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=5800207676\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It publishes original research papers, short communications, state-of-the-art mini-reviews, letters to the editor, clinical-case studies, announcements of pertinent international meetings, and editorials. The journal covers a broad spectrum and brings together various disciplines, for example, zoology, microbiology, molecular biology, genetics, mathematical modelling, veterinary and human medicine. Multidisciplinary approaches and the use of conventional and novel methods/methodologies (in the field and in the laboratory) are crucial for deeper understanding of the natural processes and human behaviour/activities that result in human or animal diseases and in economic effects of ticks and tick-borne pathogens. Such understanding is essential for management of tick populations and tick-borne diseases in an effective and environmentally acceptable manner.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Microbiology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Parasitology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700166804&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700166804\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

We include studies of micro-organisms, algae, macrophytes, invertebrates, fish and other vertebrates, as well as those concerning whole systems and related physical and chemical aspects of the environment, provided that they have clear biological relevance. Studies may focus at any level in the ecological hierarchy from physiological ecology and animal behaviour, through population dynamics and evolutionary genetics, to community interactions, biogeography and ecosystem functioning. They may also be at any scale: from microhabitat to landscape, and continental to global. Preference is given to research, whether meta-analytical, experimental, theoretical or descriptive, highlighting causal (ecological) mechanisms from which clearly stated hypotheses are derived. Manuscripts with an experimental or conceptual flavour are particularly welcome, as are those or which integrate laboratory and field work, and studies from less well researched areas of the world. Priority is given to submissions that are likely to interest a wide range of readers. We encourage submission of papers well grounded in ecological theory that deal with issues related to the conservation and management of inland waters. Papers interpreting fundamental research in a way that makes clear its applied, strategic or socio-economic relevance are also welcome. Review articles (FRESHWATER BIOLOGY REVIEWS) and discussion papers (OPINION) are also invited: these enable authors to publish high-quality material outside the constraints of standard research papers.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15112&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15112\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

European Geriatric Medicine has a specific focus on Geriatric Medicine unlike the majority of other broader Gerontology journals. Launched in 2010, its scope is to provide a comprehensive and updated forum on all aspects of Geriatric Medicine, both with a clinical and academic focus. The EuGMS is interested, through this journal, in the promotion of Geriatric Medicine in any setting (acute or subacute care, rehabilitation, nursing homes, primary care, fall clinics, ambulatory assessment, dementia clinics..), and also in functionality in old age, comprehensive geriatric assessment, geriatric syndromes, education, models of care in health services (with a special interest in projects funded by the European Union) and quality assurance. A panel of international authoritative and highly specialized scientists constitutes the Editorial Board, representing areas such as geriatric pharmacology, cardiovascular geriatric medicine, sarcopenia&frailty, neurodegenerative diseases, geriatric emergency care and ethics/end of life care for older people. European Geriatric Medicine does not publish research in basic (laboratory or animal models) or social sciences or other wider aspects of gerontology and aging. European Geriatric Medicine has a global reach and is intended to geriatricians, other members of the geriatric team (nurses, therapists, educators), researchers, administrators/decision makers, students, and also professionals working in borderline specialties (rehabilitation, cardiology, neurology…).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geriatrics and Gerontology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Gerontology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19700175204&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19700175204\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The objective of the journal is to publish novel information leading to a better understanding of biological mechanisms of human diseases, their prevention, diagnosis, and patient management. Reports of an applied clinical character are also welcome. Papers concerned with normal metabolic processes or with constituents of normal cells or body fluids, such as reports of experimental or clinical studies in animals, are only considered when they are clearly and directly relevant to human disease. Evaluation of commercial products have a low priority for publication, unless they are novel or represent a technological breakthrough. Studies dealing with effects of drugs and natural products and studies dealing with the redox status in various diseases are not within the journal's scope. Development and evaluation of novel analytical methodologies where applicable to diagnostic clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine, including point-of-care testing, and topics on laboratory management and informatics will also be considered.

Several events, in particular the developments in DNA-based technology, have contributed to this evolution. Clinical cancer genetics has now matured to a medical discipline which is truly multidisciplinary in which clinical and molecular geneticists work together with clinical and medical oncologists as well as with psycho-social workers. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of clinical cancer genetics most papers are currently being published in a wide variety of journals on epidemiology, oncology and genetics. Familial Cancer provides a forum bringing these topics together focusing on the interests and needs of the clinician. The journal mainly concentrates on clinical cancer genetics. Most major areas in the field shall be included, such as epidemiology of familial cancer, molecular analysis and diagnosis, clinical expression, treatment and prevention, counselling and the health economics of familial cancer.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Cancer Research","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Cancer
