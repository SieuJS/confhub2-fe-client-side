The focus is on the research methods, properties, and results characteristic of few-body systems. Examples of few-body systems range from few-quark states, light nuclear and hadronic systems; few-electron atomic systems and small molecules; and specific systems in condensed matter and surface physics (such as quantum dots and highly correlated trapped systems), up to and including large-scale celestial structures. Systems for which an equivalent one-body description is available or can be designed, and large systems for which specific many-body methods are needed are outside the scope of the journal. The journal is devoted to the publication of all aspects of few-body systems research and applications. While concentrating on few-body systems well-suited to rigorous solutions, the journal also encourages interdisciplinary contributions that foster common approaches and insights, introduce and benchmark the use of novel tools (e.g. machine learning) and develop relevant applications (e.g. few-body aspects in quantum technologies).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=27573&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=27573\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

East Asian economies that started to develop somewhat earlier, following the Japanese lead, remain among the most important economies in the world. The emergent regions of South and Southeast Asia have many dynamic economic sectors. Public policy, governance and development issues are drawing increasing attention not only from academia but also from the wider business, professional and policy communities. Since its official launch in 2008, JAPP has become one of the major public policy journals with a strong focus on issues related to development, policy and governance in Asia from comparative and international perspectives. JAPP , as one of the key venues for Area Studies, particularly welcomes contributions with strong comparative analysis relevant to current policy debates. Cross-regional studies of Asian interactions with other major global regions, and interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary research, are definitely welcome.

The journal encourages scholarly debate amongst professionals involved in practice, theory, research, and training in all areas of scholarship relevant to REBT and CBT. The Journal is particularly interested in articles that define clinical practice and research and theoretical articles that have direct clinical applications. The Journal seeks theoretical discussions and literature reviews on the cognitive bases of the development and alleviation of emotional, behavioral, interpersonal, personality, and addictive disorders. We consider submissions on the applications of REBT and CBT to new areas of practice and client populations. The Journal considers the term Cognitive Behavior Therapy to represent a generic, overriding category or school of psychotherapy approaches that includes many different theories and techniques. The journals encourages research that clearly identifies the specific hypothetical constructs and techniques being measured, tested, and discussed, and the comparison of the relative influence of different cognitive processes, constructs, and techniques on emotional and behavioral disturbance.

While many relevant definitions of patient experience endure, we reference the definition (slightly modified) from The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Patient experience encompasses the range of interactions that individuals and families have with the healthcare system, including their care from health plans, and from doctors, nurses, and staff in hospitals, physician practices, and other healthcare facilities / providers. As an integral component of health care quality and equity, patient experience includes several aspects of health care delivery that consumers value highly when they seek and receive care, such as getting timely appointments, easy access to information, and good communication with health care providers1. We strive to provide readers with open-access, timely, peer reviewed, articles and commentary about the intersection of healthcare delivered (i.e. the clinician) and those receiving the service (i.e. the consumer / patient / family). By publishing research findings, case reports, and perspective, we aim to support systemic, equitable, and inclusive change to improve the healthcare experience for all.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health Policy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Health (social science)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Leadership and Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Leadership and Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Leadership and Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Leadership and Management","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101039771&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101039771\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It explores family life, relationships and generational issues across the life course. Bringing together a range of social science perspectives, with a strong policy and practice focus, it is also strongly informed by sociological theory and the latest methodological approaches. The title 'Families, Relationships and Societies' encompasses the fluidity, complexity and diversity of contemporary social and personal relationships and their need to be understood in the context of different societies and cultures. International and comprehensive in scope, FRS covers a range of theoretical, methodological and substantive issues, from large scale trends, processes of social change and social inequality to the intricacies of family practices. It welcomes scholarship based on theoretical, qualitative or quantitative analysis. High quality research and scholarship is accepted across a wide range of issues. Examples include family policy, changing relationships between personal life, work and employment, shifting meanings of parenting, issues of care and intimacy, the emergence of digital friendship, shifts in transnational sexual relationships, effects of globalising and individualising forces and the expansion of alternative ways of doing family. Encouraging methodological innovation, and seeking to present work on all stages of the life course, the journal welcomes explorations of relationships and families in all their different guises and across different societies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Sociology and Political Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100416483&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100416483\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It is the leading journal in Britain for the dissemination of international research in religion and education and for the scholarly discussion of issues concerning religion and education internationally. The British Journal of Religious Education promotes research which contributes to our understanding of the relationship between religion and education in all phases of formal and non-formal educational settings. BJRE publishes articles which are national, international and transnational in scope from researchers working in any discipline whose work informs debate in religious education.

The journal encourages greater interaction between the basic and applied sub-disciplines of magnetism with comprehensive review articles, in addition to full-length contributions. In addition, other categories of contributions are welcome, including Critical Focused issues, Current Perspectives and Outreach to the General Public. Main Categories: Full-length articles: Technically original research documents that report results of value to the communities that comprise the journal audience. The link between chemical, structural and microstructural properties on the one hand and magnetic properties on the other hand are encouraged. In addition to general topics covering all areas of magnetism and magnetic materials, the full-length articles also include three sub-sections, focusing on Nanomagnetism, Spintronics and Applications. The sub-section on Nanomagnetism contains articles on magnetic nanoparticles, nanowires, thin films, 2D materials and other nanoscale magnetic materials and their applications.

The journal provides a forum for research in the algorithmic treatment of all types of symbolic objects: objects in formal languages (terms, formulas, programs); algebraic objects (elements in basic number domains, polynomials, residue classes, etc.); and geometrical objects. It is the explicit goal of the journal to promote the integration of symbolic computation by establishing one common avenue of communication for researchers working in the different subareas.

Yet, all too often, nuances that are critical for an experiment’s success are not captured in the primary literature but exist only as part of a lab’s oral tradition. The aim of each Current Protocols title is to provide the clearest, most detailed and reliable step-by-step instructions for all protocols relevant to a given subject area. Written by experts in the field and extensively edited to our exacting standards, the protocols include all of the information necessary to complete an experiment in the laboratory—introduction, materials lists with supplier information, detailed step-by-step procedures with helpful annotations, recipes for reagents and solutions, illustrative figures and information-packed tables. Each article also provides invaluable discussions of background information, applications of the methods, important assumptions, key parameters, time considerations, and tips to help avoid common pitfalls and troubleshoot experiments. Furthermore, Current Protocols content is thoughtfully organized by topic for optimal usage and to maximize contextual knowledge. Quarterly issues allow Current Protocols in Protein Science to constantly evolve to keep pace with the newest discoveries and developments.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biochemistry","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Structural Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11600153418&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11600153418\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Research using any approach to increase our understanding of multisensory perceptual, behavioural, neural and computational mechanisms is encouraged. Empirical, neurophysiological, psychophysical, brain imaging, clinical, developmental, mathematical and computational analyses are welcome. Research will also be considered covering multisensory applications such as sensory substitution, crossmodal methods for delivering sensory information or multisensory approaches to robotics and engineering. Short communications and technical notes that draw attention to new developments will be included, as will reviews and commentaries on current issues. Special issues dealing with specific topics will be announced from time to time. Multisensory Research is a continuation of Seeing and Perceiving, and of Spatial Vision.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Cognitive

As of 2016 the Journal publishes Open Access. The journal follows international research standards and strives for international visibility. With its empirical and multidisciplinary orientation, the journal publishes papers in English language concerning the labour market, employment, education / training and careers. Papers dealing with country-specific labour market aspects are suitable if they adopt an innovative approach and address a topic of interest to a wider international audience. The journal is distinct from most others in the field, as it provides a platform for contributions from a broad range of academic disciplines. The editors encourage replication studies, as well as studies based on international comparisons. Accordingly, authors are expected to make their empirical data available to readers who might wish to replicate a published work on request. Submitted papers, who have passed a prescreening process by the editors, are generally reviewed by two peer reviewers, who remain anonymous for the author. In addition to the regular issues, special issues covering selected topics are published at least once a year. As of April 2015 the Journal for Labour Market Research has a \"No Revisions\" option for submissions (see ‘Instructions for Authors’).","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Economics and Econometrics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Industrial Relations","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100466201&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100466201\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The science of biomechanics helps explain the causes of cell, tissue, organ and body system disorders, and supports clinicians in the diagnosis, prognosis and evaluation of treatment methods and technologies. Clinical Biomechanics aims to strengthen the links between laboratory and clinic by publishing cutting-edge biomechanics research which helps to explain the causes of injury and disease, and which provides evidence contributing to improved clinical management. A rigorous peer review system is employed and every attempt is made to process and publish top-quality papers promptly. Clinical Biomechanics explores all facets of body system, organ, tissue and cell biomechanics, with an emphasis on medical and clinical applications of the basic science aspects. The role of basic science is therefore recognized in a medical or clinical context. The readership of the journal closely reflects its multi-disciplinary contents, being a balance of scientists, engineers and clinicians. The contents are in the form of research papers, brief reports, review papers and correspondence, whilst special interest issues and supplements are published from time to time. Disciplines covered include biomechanics and mechanobiology at all scales, bioengineering and use of tissue engineering and biomaterials for clinical applications, biophysics, as well as biomechanical aspects of medical robotics, ergonomics, physical and occupational therapeutics and rehabilitation.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Biophysics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Orthopedics

Cleaner Waste Systems publishes current research on waste management solutions and policies, education, and economic and environmental assessments and aims to offer an interdisciplinary overview of recent research encouraging discussion and debate on how to achieve Cleaner Waste Systems from government, business, academia and society. The journal provides a key platform for publishing high-quality interdisciplinary papers on research and practice in the field, also including theoretical theses and innovative strategies as well as case-studies from practitioners. It looks outstandingly at the patterns of waste treatment to help identify more-sustainable solutions for waste systems and influence the so-called \"end of life\" of many products and flows. Though open to all scientific backgrounds, Cleaner Waste Systems will privilege contributions aimed at tackling the problem of waste generation and treatment under a systemic and relational viewpoint rather than devoted to a single molecule, process, product type, technology, in isolation from the context.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Science (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Waste Management and Disposal","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101165602&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101165602\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

All relevant aspects of molecular biology, genetics and cell biochemistry, of process and reactor design, of pre- and post-treatment steps, and of manufacturing or service operations are therefore included. Contributions from industrial and academic laboratories are equally welcome. We also welcome contributions covering biotechnological aspects of regenerative medicine and biomaterials and also cancer biotechnology. Criteria for the acceptance of papers relate to our aim of publishing useful and informative results that will be of value to other workers in related fields. The emphasis is very much on novelty and immediacy in order to justify rapid publication of authors’ results. It should be noted, however, that we do not normally publish papers (but this is not absolute) that deal with unidentified consortia of microorganisms (e.g. as in activated sludge) as these results may not be easily reproducible in other laboratories. Papers describing the isolation and identification of microorganisms are not regarded as appropriate but such information can be appended as supporting information to a paper. Papers dealing with simple process development are usually considered to lack sufficient novelty or interest to warrant publication.","Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15516&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15516\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It cultivates and celebrates topnotch scholarship in the field of socio-ecological practice research across all four intertwined streams of scholarly inquiry—knowledge (co)production, transfer, implementation, and impact—with a specific focus on knowledge implementation and impact research (i.e., knowledge I&I research). Socio-ecological practice research is practitioner-inspired, use-oriented, place-specific basic research for ecological practice (i.e., ecological planning, design, construction, restoration, and management; or any of their combinations). It is conducted by scholar-practitioners who are motivated, through a rigorous transdisciplinary process, to both help improve ecological practice and extend the frontiers of fundamental understanding. A socio-ecological practice research project is thus necessarily • From practice—inspired by real-world practitioners who have specific knowledge needs to improve ecological practice in particular circumstances; • For practice—motivated and often, but not necessarily, commissioned to meet practitioners’ specific knowledge needs under usefulness requirements. The outcomes are useful to practitioners, accepted and actually used in their practice; • Beyond practice—committed to tracking knowledge implementation and impact in practice, and motivated to impart the acquired knowledge, experience, lessons, and discernment to the international communities of scholars and practitioners.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Nature and Landscape Conservation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101085533&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101085533\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Pharm. Bull.) began publication in 1978 as the Journal of Pharmacobio-Dynamics. It covers various biological topics in the pharmaceutical and health sciences. A fourth Society journal, the Journal of Health Science, was merged with Biol. Pharm. Bull. in 2012. The main aim of the Society’s journals is to advance the pharmaceutical sciences with research reports, information exchange, and high-quality discussion. The average review time for articles submitted to the journals is around one month for first decision. The complete texts of all of the Society’s journals can be freely accessed through J-STAGE. The Society’s editorial committee hopes that the content of its journals will be useful to your research, and also invites you to submit your own work to the journals.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Medicine (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Medicine

It is the proud companion title to Epilepsy & Behavior (Steven Schachter, Editor-in-Chief). EBR places special emphasis on articles that: 1.Provide guidance to clinicians around the world to provide education on best practices and clinical research for global epilepsy management of patients regarding epilepsy and behavior; 2.Report cutting-edge multi-disciplinary science related to seizures and epilepsy (Basic and Translational Science); 3.Educate readers about relevant and practical clinical outcomes in seizures and epilepsy (Outcome Research); 4.Cite important observations that significantly add to previously-reported novel observations, or provide compelling illustrations of important clinical principles related to the care of patients (Case Reports); and 5.Summarize or editorialize the current state of the literature (Reviews, Commentaries, and Editorials). EBR accepts most types of manuscripts for consideration including original research papers, case reports, case report series, short communications, reviews, letters to the editor, opinions and editorials. Topics considered will be from seizure- and epilepsy-related fields that are of interest to practicing physicians all over the world. Examples of recent topics include epilepsy and autoimmunity, brain function, neurostimulation, status epilepticus, alternative treatment, biomarkers, psychopathology, detection and predictive methods, novel neuroimaging findings, and EEG and video-EEG aspects etc.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Behavioral Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Neurology (clinical)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100967241&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100967241\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

It welcomes high quality submissions regardless of the tradition or school of thought from which they derive. As an editorial priority, however, presentations should be accessible to the philosophical community at large and as free as possible of any jargon and formal apparatus. Ethical Theory and Moral Practice aims to publish work on (meta-)ethical theories that contributes to clarifying and solving practical moral problems, as well as work that makes empirical studies of moral practices and problems relevant for ethical theorizing. It is also interested in work that critically reflects on the plausibility and practicability of ethical theories in the light of insights from empirical sciences. The journal therefore seeks to promote cross-fertilisation between moral philosophy, theology, law, political theory, and more empirical disciplines, such as medicine, economics, sociology, and psychology.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Philosophy","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=23509&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=23509\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Studies describing the involvement of stem cells in nervous system maintenance and disease (including brain tumours), stem cell-based approaches for the investigation of neurodegenerative diseases, roles of neuroinflammation in development and disease, and neuroevolution are also encouraged. Investigations using molecular, cellular, physiological, genetic and epigenetic approaches in model systems ranging from simple invertebrates to human iPSC-based 2D and 3D models are encouraged, as are studies using experimental models that provide behavioural or evolutionary insights. The journal also publishes Special Issues dealing with topics at the cutting edge of research edited by Guest Editors appointed by the Editor in Chief. A major aim of the journal is to facilitate the transfer of fundamental studies of nervous system development, maintenance, and disease to clinical applications. The journal thus intends to disseminate valuable information for both biologists and physicians. International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience is owned and supported by The International Society for Developmental Neuroscience (ISDN), an organization of scientists interested in advancing developmental neuroscience research in the broadest sense.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Biology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2005","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Developmental Neuroscience","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=16147&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=16147\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal publishes articles on a variety of subjects of interest to practitioners and researchers in the field of osteo-articular and soft-tissue infections. These are comprised of articles on prosthetic joint infection, long bone osteomyelitis, spinal infections, necrotizing soft-tissue infections, septic arthritis, hand infections, diabetic foot infections, biofilm-related infections, fracture-related infections, and bone and soft tissue reconstruction. These infections may present with an acute or chronic history, with fulminant or low-grade symptoms. We welcome articles that include research on both adults and children. The journal scope also includes the prevention of musculoskeletal infections, concepts on diagnostics and treatment, and the optimization of these procedures. The combination of medical and surgical treatment is a precondition to face these demanding infections, in particular when considering that multi-drug-resistant bacteria are a major a concern in our healthcare system. Next to clinical articles, EBJIS and MSIS encourage authors to submit sub-clinical and basic research articles to JBJI, including manuscripts on biomaterials, bone substitutes, biofilm eradication, and microorganisms. It is our mission to optimize forces in the treatment and spot early future trends in bone and joint infection management. To be suitable for publication in JBJI, articles should describe substantial advancements in the field and include significant innovation.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Infectious Diseases","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Surgery","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101047090&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101047090\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

As these conditions interact and change, the impact on human communities increases in size, scale, and scope. Such interactions necessarily need to be analyzed from an interdisciplinary perspective that includes both social and technical measures. For decision makers, the risk presents the challenge of managing known hazards, but unknown consequences in time of occurrence, scale of impact, and level of disruption in actual communities with limited resources. The journal is dedicated to bringing together the physical, social, and behavioral sciences; engineering; and the regulatory and policy environments to provide a forum for cutting edge, holistic, and cross-disciplinary approaches to anticipating risk, loss, and cost reduction from natural hazards. The journal welcomes rigorous research on the intersection between social and technical systems that advances concepts of resilience within lifeline and infrastructure systems and the organizations that manage them for all hazards. It offers a professional forum for researchers and practitioners working together to publish the results of truly interdisciplinary and partnered approaches to the anticipation of risk, loss reduction, and community resilience. Engineering topics covered include the characterization of hazard forces and the planning, design, construction, maintenance, performance, and use of structures in the physical environment. Social and behavioral sciences topics include analysis of the impact of hazards on communities and the organizations that seek to mitigate and manage response to hazards.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2001","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural

This implies that we will only consider papers that explicitly contribute to relevant academic literature, as documented in international peer-reviewed journals. We expect the introduction of every paper submitted to EJTIR to contain a review of past work on the paper's topic, which is used to explicitly identify an academic knowlegde gap. In addition, we expect submitted papers to clearly mention in the introduction the aimed for contribution in terms of filling the identified knowledge gap. Note that the large majority of the >70% of papers that are rejected in our desk review-process are rejected because they fail to convincingly argue their contribution to the scholarly literature. We do not only want to contribute to the academic debate on transport and infrastructure, we also want to contribute to practice. We are primarily interested in publishing research that makes a real difference in addressing the immense and growing challenges of today’s transport systems. This means that EJTIR encourages submission of scholarly papers that explicitly aim to support decision-making and policy-making in the field of transport and infrastructure. Transport and infrastructure can be studied from a wide range of perspectives. EJTIR takes a special interest in the behavioral, organizational, economic, and/or public policy dimensions of the planning and operations of transport systems. We are interested in theory, models and methods, as well as novel empirical work; and we consider all modes of transport. Examples of topics that fall outside the scope of EJTIR include papers discussing topics such as supply chain-optimization, traffic flow theory (especially highly technical contributions), optimal asphalt mixtures, vehicle routing problems, technical requirements for vehicle-to-vehicle communication, internal company logistics...","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Transportation","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=11900154359&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=11900154359\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal also encourages authors to publish datasets alongside their published papers and can support audio or video files within the publication.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Architecture","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Architecture","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Architecture","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Architecture","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Architecture","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Civil and Structural Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Environmental Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Geography, Planning and Development","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Mechanical Engineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Urban Studies","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100932523&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100932523\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

JoC will accomplish this by publishing original and scientifically-sound research on creativity and by encouraging the interdisciplinary study of creativity. It will maximize accessibility to scholars by limiting the length of articles to 10 printed pages and avoiding long entries. In addition, each article will include exploration of the implications of the research. Thus the understanding of creativity will be furthered in several ways. First JoC will publish rigorous research which will be published only after careful peer review. Second, JoC articles will each examine what the research means for \"the real world and natural environment. Third, JoC will allow all disciplines to communicate about the topic of creativity. Each article will be well-connected to the existing creativity research (confirmed in part by the citations) and provide enough information in the description of the methodology to allow reviewers and readers to judge the validity of the work and to allow replication by others, if justified. Research examining the creative process, creative potential, creative products, the individual traits that contribute to creative achievement, and the environments which support or hinder creative efforts will all be published. This range of perspectives, along with the variety reflecting the interdisciplinarity of the JoC, will engage scholars and contribute to scientific advance. Such scientific advancement is expected, given what is known about creativity (e.g., that it benefits from the questioning of assumptions, flexibility, openness to alternatives) and in a sense gives JoC a meta-creative scope.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Experimental and Cognitive Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101175729&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101175729\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

JOR publishes work on the insect order Orthoptera and its allies, Blattodea, Mantodea, Phasmatodea, Grylloblattodea, Mantophasmatodea and Dermaptera. Its goal is the dissemination of ideas and insights arising from the study of these insects. Papers published cover a range of biological and evolutionary studies of these insects including their diversity, phylogeny, conservation, and the control and management of pest species. Acceptable studies fall within the disciplines of cytology, biological control, morphology, physiology, parasitology, endocrinology, behavior, ecology, systematics, biogeography, and taxonomy. The journal encourages comprehensive and synthetic papers and those utilizing modern techniques. Case studies of interesting phenomena are also appropriate, as long as they are contextualized in terms of their significance to orthopterology and entomology in general. Alongside original research, JOR also publishes review articles, short communications, and articles focusing on policy and management of Orthoptera. Two issues are published biannually, and members of the Orthopterists’ Society publish free.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Animal Science and Zoology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2002","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2003","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2004","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2006","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2007","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2008","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2009","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Insect Science","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=19500157423&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=19500157423\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

JPAE is the official journal of the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA). The journal is dedicated to advancing the scholarship of public administration education. Public affairs is a field of practice, and as practitioners and scholars, we need to engage continually in discussions that seek to strengthen instruction. JPAE fulfills a vital role in our field by serving as the top research journal for this dialogue on pedagogy. Thus, the mission of the journal is to be a forum for scholarly discussions on teaching the public affairs programs. The journal welcomes manuscripts that report research on pedagogy in public affairs programs; the administration of public affairs programs; issues facing instructors in the classroom; trends in the field of public administration; case studies that illustrate public administration principles in practice; and other vital topics.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Education","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Education","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Public Administration","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100897051&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100897051\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal’s content addresses broad conceptual questions and investigations about the ecology and management of aquatic environments. Environments range from groundwaters, wetlands and streams to estuaries, rocky shores, reefs and the open ocean. Subject areas include, but are not limited to: aquatic ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling; biology; ecology; biogeochemistry; biogeography and phylogeography; hydrology; limnology; oceanography; toxicology; conservation and management; and ecosystem services. Contributions that are interdisciplinary and of wide interest and consider the social-ecological and institutional issues associated with managing marine and freshwater ecosystems are welcomed. Manuscripts that are largely theoretical, or focused on the biology or physiology of specific taxa, or on modeling or fisheries without adequate reference to the aquatic environment are generally not considered.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aquatic Science","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Aquatic

The journal can only accept papers whose primary subject area lies within the above Aims & Scope. In particular, please take notice of the following: In order to be acceptable, manuscripts of more mathematical nature should at least attempt a connection to physical insight or new qualitative features. The word \"Solitons\" should be understood as a label especially extended to all nonlinear integrable systems in complex natural phenomena. The paper should not bear on some explicit formulae, some standard solutions, constructions, or asymptotic methods. The journal is interested in articles providing strong insights in the mathematical theory of fractals that play an important role either in understanding the general theory or are profound for an important particular application, especially in complex systems. Numerical computations should only assist the developed results. Also welcome are the discovery of new fractals that are crucial for important applications.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Mathematics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mathematical Physics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mathematical Physics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mathematical Physics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Mathematics (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100894514&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100894514\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The journal publishes articles and reviews in the fields of economic, business and social history with a particular focus on the Nordic countries and the Baltic region. The journal also publishes contributions from closely related fields, such as demographic and labour history, as well as articles dealing with theoretical and methodological issues. The editors aim to reflect contemporary research, thinking and debate in these fields, within Scandinavia and throughout the world. Authors are therefore expected to place their work within the context of the wider international literature on economic, business and social history. The journal thus comprises a broad variety of aspects and approaches, ranging from macroeconomic history to business history, from quantitative to qualitative studies.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Aerospace Engineering","Year":"1999","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Aerospace Engineering","Year":"2000","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Aerospace

Serving as a platform for the most recent results in all aspects of biological sciences, Communcative & Integrative Biology focuses on exploring every level of biological organizations. From subcellular organelles to societies, the understanding of biological organisms as systems integrated via bio-communication. This encompasses animal, plant, and microbial communication, as well as signaling, cognition, consciousness, evolution, ecology, and behavioral ecology. Organismal behavior is based on integrated sensory systems. These provide organisms with positive and negative experiences and memories, allowing active and effective adaptation to an ever-changing environment. Intraorganismal communication and integrated signaling underly the development, polarity and morphogenesis of multicellular organisms. Moreover, stress adaptation, pathogenesis, parasitism, immunity, symbiosis, mutualism and other types of interorganismal interactions are also based on various modes of biological communication.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2010","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q1"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=15900154753&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=15900154753\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

The aim of the Journal of Sport Psychology in Action (JSPA) is to provide psychology practitioners involved in the sport industry with sound information that is immediately applicable to their work. It provides sport psychologists with useful and sensible informed guidance that will make a difference in the way they practice. The scope of JSPA is any information that assists sport psychology practitioners to better understand, assess, and intervene with clients (individuals, families, groups, organizations, community) in order to promote more effective functioning. In all sport settings, practitioners are likely to encounter a range of issues that require understanding of performance enhancement, health and well-being, clinical disorders, ethical guidelines and dilemmas, all forms of diversity, coaching and support, and so forth. Although the core audience of JSPA is psychologists and consultants practicing in the sport domain, we also wish to appeal to a range of other informed delivers and consumers, including students, trainee psychologists, educators and supervisors, sports scientists and medics, sports coaches and parents, performance directors and managers, the media, and athletes themselves.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Applied Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Human Factors and Ergonomics","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2011","Quartile":"Q4"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2012","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2013","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2014","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2015","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2016","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2017","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2018","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2019","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2020","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2021","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2022","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Social Psychology","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21100330714&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21100330714\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

This multidisciplinary open-access journal is at the forefront of disseminating and communicating scientific knowledge and impactful discoveries to academics, industry leaders and the public worldwide. Chemical engineering is a discipline influencing numerous areas of technology and offers unparalleled opportunities to address grand challenges facing society, such as energy, environment, health, food, manufacturing, among others. In broad terms, chemical engineering is concerned with the design and development of processes to produce, transform and transport molecules and materials — beginning with experimentation in the laboratory followed by implementation of the technology in full-scale production — and it occupies a unique position at the interface between molecular sciences and engineering. Modern chemical engineering spearheads new developments in energy systems, environmental solutions, medicine, biotechnology, microelectronics, advanced materials, consumer products, and manufacturing, by intimately linking with the fundamental subjects of chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and economics, and in close collaboration with fellow engineering disciplines like computer science, materials science, and mechanical, electrical, and civil engineering. On a grand scale, a chemical engineering is an ‘enabler’ to make things happen efficiently on a massive, industrial manufacturing scale with the best results at the least cost and with the lowest impact on the environment possible.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Bioengineering","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Catalysis","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Catalysis","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q3"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2023","Quartile":"Q2"},{"Category":"Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)","Year":"2024","Quartile":"Q2"}],"Thumbnail":"<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21101132466&amp;tip=sid&amp;exact=no\" title=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journal_img.php?id=21101132466\" alt=\"SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank\"  /></a>"}

Published since 1995, its paramount aim has always been to create a platform for presenting results of research in ergonomics and workplace health promotion relevant for the diverse, yet increasingly globalizing world. Whereas social and economic problems and researchers' modus operandi in various countries and climates are similar, legislation, safety and management culture are not. We are interested in showing how the same problems are studied and solved in different parts of the world and how the same methods can produce different results. Comparing those problems and views, in their diversity, helps perceive them in a wider context, in a global perspective. Our mission involves both looking at each problem in its cultural, social and economic contexts and approaching it from the broad perspective of various fields. Greater awareness follows, with authors able to connect with fellow researchers in other fields, who work on the same problems. Even though the principal objective of JOSE is to publish research, we do not perceive this aim as limited to significant original contributions to knowledge; we are also interested in contributions that prove well-known solutions can be used in practice. Everything that can make work easier and workplace health better is worthy of dissemination.","SupplementaryTable":[{"Category":"Public Health, Environmental and Occupational
